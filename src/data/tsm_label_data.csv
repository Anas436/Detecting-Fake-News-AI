True! Sierra Leone was elected as a non-permanent member of the...,Gloria Wleh,"Claim: Sierra Leone was voted as a non-permanent member to the UN Security Council.Verdict: True! The United Nations official website published that Sierra Leone is elected as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council.Full Text:Sierra Leone held its fifth election on June 24, 2023, since its decade-long civil war ended in 2002. In the lead-up to the election, the country experienced some hot crises in 2022, leaving many dead, including security officers.A few days after the country’s voting day, there was a clash between citizens and state security officers, leaving one person dead.Giving a comparative analysis of the just-ended Sierra Leone elections and lessons Liberia can enrol, the Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Information Cultural Affairs and Tourism (MICAT), Boakai Fofana said, Sierra Leone and Liberia have an economic situation, averring, Sierra Leone’s economic situation is far worse than Liberia, something he said led to a political crisis in 2022 that killed twenty-two (22) people.He can be heard at the (1:45:39 to 1:46:28) of panel discussion on the OK Morning Rush.But dismissing what he termed as shameful on the part of Deputy Minister Fofana to compare the success of President George Weah with Sierra Leone’s President Julius Madaa Bio, Mohammed Ali said, President Bio has given Sierra Leone an international presence by making it to be “elected as a non-permanent member to the UN Security Council.”The UP Campaign Spokesman furthers his assertion from 1:47:57 to 1:50:49 of the show saying, there are lots of dissimilarities between President Weah and President Bio, for which they can not be compared.But did the UP Campaign Spokesman get his facts right? What does it mean for a country to be elected as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council? TSM checks that.Verification: On June 6, 2023, the United Nations published on its official website that five countries have been elected as non-permanent members of the UN Security Council.The five countries included Algeria, Guyana, Republic of Korea, Sierra Leone and Slovenia.In the publication, the President of the 77th session of the United Nations General Assembly is seen congratulating the five countries for being elected as non-permanent members of the UN Security Council.What is the UN Security Council?The Security Council takes the lead in determining the existence of a threat to the peace or an act of aggression. It calls upon the parties to a dispute to settle it by peaceful means and recommends methods of adjustment or terms of settlement. In some cases, the Security Council can resort to imposing sanctions or even authorising the use of force to maintain or restore international peace and security.How can a country become part of the UN Security Council?The Security Council is composed of 15 countries, five of which – China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States – are permanent members, granting them the right to veto any resolution or decision.The 10 non-permanent members are elected by the General Assembly, which comprises all 193 UN Member States and is in line with geographical distribution by region for two-year terms.Voting is conducted by secret ballot and candidates must receive a two-thirds majority, or 128 votes, even if they run uncontested.Liberia has been elected one time in 1961 as a member of the UN Security Council, while Sierra Leone has been elected more than once.Conclusion: Unity Party Campaign Spokesman’s claim that Sierra Leone was elected as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council is true.Related ",11/07/2023,https://tsmliberia.com/true-sierra-leone-was-elected-as-a-non-permanent-member-of-the-un-security-council/,1
"Correct, Costa Got 8 Percent In 2017 Elections",R. Joyclyn Wea,"Claim: Henry Costa only got 3,287 votes which constitute 8%.Source: public figure and student leader Martin K. N. KollieVerdict: True, Henry Costa Obtained 8% vote in the 2017 Representative elections.Full Text:  Martin Kollie, a social media activist, posted on Facebook a claim that Henry Costa, a political talk-show host, accumulated 8% of the votes in the 2017 elections.Costa contested on the All Liberian Party (ALP) ticket in Monsterrado District No. 6.Kollie who supports Joseph Nyumah Boakai, the Unity Party’s standard bearer, took to his Facebook page to react to some of the comments made by Costa during his live press conference.Costa previously supported former Vice President Boakai’s presidential bid but he revealed a tale of betrayal and broken promises in his press conference. He also announced the ALP’s decision to sever ties with the Unity Party and Boakai due to “betrayal”. In response to some of the points made in Costa’s press release, Martin said Costa as a representative candidate of district six, Montserrado County obtained 3287 votes or 8% of the vote.“You only got 3,287 votes, which constitutes 8%. You don’t have a ‘strong favorability’ even in a District. How then is that possible in a county or an entire country? Did Con-Star say he turned down 30 million USD? When did he become a maestro of comedy? I will address this claim in part 2.”The post generated 136 SHARES, 408 reactions and 494 comments.Verification: We checked the National Elections Commission (NEC) website and it was established that the data provided by Martin is authentic. Of the total 42,506 votes, Costa obtained 3,287 votes constituting 8% taking fourth place in the 2017 elections.The National Elections Commission (NEC), is in charge of overseeing and enforcing all election laws as well as holding elections for all elective public offices.The Liberian Constitution served as the foundation for NEC historically.

What Did Representative Foko Say about Weah’s One-Term Bid?,Mark Mengonfia,"There have been a variety of responses to a statement made by Frank Saah Foko, district nine of Montserrado County.Foko participated (32 mins:18 seconds) in the Montserrado County District #9 primary of the CDC.After he was announced (32 mins:18 seconds) winner of the process, he made remarks appreciating the support he received from delegates.After the statement of appreciation, a social media blog posted, “CDC Lawmaker Frank Saah Foko has confirmed that President Weah will be a one-term president.Speaking to his supporters, he openly said that he would form a strategic Team to ensure President Weah becomes a one-term President. Fellow Liberian, what do you say about this comment from the CDC Lawmaker?”TSM conducted a careful analysis of the audio and video recordings to determine what was said.  We also contacted Representative Foko via WhatsApp to establish what he said.Foko said he intended to say, “I will make sure that President Weah is not a one-term President.” He questioned why someone would just collect a segment of what he said.FrontPage Africa also screamed live (32 mins:18 seconds) the event.Conclusion: CDC Lawmaker Foko indeed said those words; but in a telephone conversation; the lawmaker said he intended to say, “I will make sure that President Weah is not a one-term President.”Related ",08/07/2023,https://tsmliberia.com/what-did-representative-foko-say-about-weahs-one-term-bid/,1
The Post of Costa For President is Misleading,Mark Mengonfia,"Claim: Henry Costa to contest the 2023 presidential election with his running mate, RiverGee senator Jonathan Sogbie on the All Liberian Party (ALP) ticket.Full Text: Political commentator and talk show host Henry P. Costa’s image appeared on social media this time, not as a running mate to any political leader but as the presidential candidate of Businessman Benoni Urey’s party.Urey established the All Liberian Party (ALP) in 2017 when he contested that year’s presidential election as a presidential candidate.This claim has made rounds on both Instagram and Facebook.On Instagram, a social media user posted in pidgin, stating, “So wettin Costa doing his mouth like that for naa? Lay brelor still vex with Boakai oooo.”This pidgin, when interpreted, means Costa is still angry with former Vice President Joseph Boakai.Also, Dream TV posted the same but said they couldn’t verify the claim.Verification: Our researcher contacted Leaders of the ALP and Henry P.

The Cut in the 2023 Elections Budget,Gloria Wleh,"In March this year, the Chairperson of the National Elections Commission (NEC), Madame Davidetta Browne Lansanah disclosed that the budget for the October 10, 2023 General and Presidential Elections was “adjusted by the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning (MFDP) from US$91million to US$33million.”As a result of the adjustment, the Biometric Voter Registration (BVR) which should have taken place simultaneously was conducted in two faces, the Training of Trainers (TOT) which should have also been conducted for ten days was conducted for a few days, while complaints about the shortages of the BVR cards were heard across sides of the country.Following the announcement of the slice of the elections budget, the United States government through its Ambassador, Micheal McCarthy, called on the government of Liberia to “provide the Elections Commission with its full 2023 budget so it has the necessary resources to effectively prepare for and implement all aspects of the electoral process, or risk unfair elections in 2023.”Responding to the over sixty percent (60%) cut of the elections’ budget, the Communications Director of NEC, Henry Flomo said, “the budget was debated and adjusted by the government. The last time I checked, it was adjusted to around US$63 million or so. Cut-in elections budgets always happen. What the NEC is now doing is strategizing to work in what we have.”Flomo recommended that the NEC be given financial autonomy to work easily and promptly, void of adjustments.“The Commission has a constitutional mandate, which is to conduct elections in time. So, a lot of things will be adjusted as the cash is adjusted. But when we have control over our financial coffers, we can go there anytime to get whatever we want.”Flomo however urged members of the public not to panic about the credibility of the upcoming elections saying, no part of the electoral process has been stalled to endanger the nation’s democracy.‘There should be no reason to panic. The issue of transparency is being upheld by us. That is why we have accredited media people, civil society organizations, party agents, international people and those who want to observe or report on the registration to do so.“And we have not stopped any of the activity leading to the participation, or inclusion of every Liberian who has an interest in the elections. So there’s no way one would say democracy is threatened. Until those things are stopped, then one can say the democracy of the state is threatened.”When asked if the adjusted money allocated for this year’s elections was sufficient for the conduct of the election, Flomo responded by saying, “My boss has already spoken about that to the House of Senate.”Oscar Bloh is the Chairperson of the Elections Coordinating Committee (ECC). The ECC is a coalition of civic society organizations that observed elections in Liberia.Giving the ECC’s take on the cut of the upcoming elections budget, Bloh stated, “NEC in negotiating with the Ministry of Finance adjusted the budget. They are in the know if the budget reduction is sufficient to conduct the elections. If it wasn’t sufficient, they would have said it. Keeping silent means the money is enough.”The ECC Chairperson indicated that the elections are constitutionally mandated, and it’s the government’s responsibility to provide resources for the conduct of the elections. Additionally, it is constitutionally scheduled and as such, they (the government) should have planned better.Oscar Bloh recounted, “the Liberia Revenue Authority on numerous occasions said it has exceeded projected revenue collection. So, the government is in a position to fund these elections. It needs to prioritize these elections, by showing its commitment and will, because it is required by law.”He expressed fear about the quality of the elections which is contingent on the availability of resources.“If resources are slow in coming, it will undermine the quality of the elections. And when the process is compromised, we run the risk of compromising the outcome,” Bloh noted.But there are other electoral supports from foreign nations and organizations to the NEC. The Liberia Electoral Support Project (LEDP) supports the Government of Liberia through the National Elections Commission (NEC) to conduct credible, transparent, inclusive, and peaceful elections. Also, the United Nations Elections Basket, to name a few.On July 30, 2021, the Embassy of Sweden in Monrovia, representing the Government of Sweden, signed an agreement with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to contribute approximately USD 4.8 million to the Liberia Electoral Support Project (LESP) for the period from 1 August 2021 to 31 December 2024.Could it be, as a result of some of those technical supports that are given to the NEC, that the budget for the upcoming elections received such a huge cut? Or, it is just about the routine that election budgets should be cut almost every time by the MFDP. The world watches as the NEC leads Liberia from scratch to finish during these crucial electioneering times of the country.Related ",23/06/2023,https://tsmliberia.com/the-cut-in-the-2023-elections-budget/,1
Is UP Ticket a Ritual Ticket?,Bettie Johnson-Mbayo,"We have tracked thirty-four social media accounts that have labelled the former Vice President Joseph Boakai; Unity Party ticket as the Ritual Ticket alias (Gboyo).
According to Liberian pidgin; “gboyo” sells human parts. 
Political commentator and owner of the radio show “The Costa Show “ in a live podcast alleged that Nimba County Senator Jeremiah Koung is a human part seller; a statement he later retracted Despite the name-calling, Boakai named Koung as his VP pick in April, almost six months before the elections. In a radio appearance in Grand Bassa, Movement for Democracy and Reconstruction (MDR) political leader Koung debunked the claim. “The only time you heard about it was when it was election time. I have never paid for an abortion before, and I believe every child has the right to live. People are trying to say things in the name of politics,” Koung said. Koung continued, “Costa realized he was wrong when he said it, so he texted me to apologize. I am a leader, and when you are a leader, they spit on you. I have multiple children in my home, and none of them has gone missing due to ritual participation.” The UP VP pick thinks that the name-calling is a myth designed to divert attention away from the real issue. Again on June 5, he denied the claim in Nimba, stating that it was a ploy to mess with his career.

Also, at the event marking the endorsement of President Weah’s second term bid by the lawmakers, a song was played there. In this music, which was performed in the presence of President Weah and all other officials of the CDC government, including House Speaker, Bhofal Chambers, Albert Tugbe Chie, CDC Chairman Mulbah Morlu and others, the musician implies that former Vice President, Joseph N. Boakai, Jeremiah K.  Koung and others were part of ritualistic killing( Gboyo). Part of the song says, “ We want George Weah, we don’t want no gboyo. Rescue 1 is Gboyo, rescue 2 is Gboyo all of them are Gboyo so we don’t want no Gboyo all we want is George Weah.”
Conclusion: The assertion that the UP ticket is Gboyo because of Vice Presidential candidate Koung is unproven.",22/06/2023,https://tsmliberia.com/is-up-ticket-a-ritual-ticket/,0
Is President Weah Correct on the Construction of Hospitals?,Bettie Johnson-Mbayo,"Claim: This government has built more hospitals than all the governments before me.Verdict: Incorrect, data shows that the president is wrong on the data.Full Text: In Liberia, following a series of crises including Ebola and Covid-19 outbreaks, the country is battling with the quality and quantity of its health workforce that requires action.When incumbent lawmakers endorsed Liberia’s President, George Manneh Weah, he claimed (31 minutes 02 seconds) that his government has built more hospitals than the government before him.According to the Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC), the June 13 event was an endorsement of incumbent lawmakers for Weah’s re-election bid.This is not the first time the claim has been made. When Weah toured Montserrado County in Logan town, he told (1:21:54 seconds) citizens that he has constructed more health facilities as compared to previous governments.Weah spoke on Monday, August 15, 2022, in Logan town, outlining his government’s development“I have built hospitals more than all the people that came before me.”Does the claim by Weah add up when we look at the numbers?Verification: Over a decade of civil war in Liberia (1989–1997 and 1999–2003), the country has its share of the devastated health system that led to the Ministry of Health Workforce Program (HWP) Strategy from 2015–2021 that reports that 293 public health facilities, of which 242, were destroyed during the 14-year civil crisis.Also, the Health Sector Performance 2006-2017 Evaluation Report, published in January 2018 states that by 2005, over 90% of Liberia’s healthcare services were delivered by external agencies and NGOs and over three-quarters of the Liberian population had no access to referral health care including emergency obstetric services.After an assessment in 2007 only 300 health facilities (including county hospitals, health centers and clinics were in Liberia, most of them dilapidated.There was important progress in Health infrastructure development from 2009 to 2011.This increased physical access to health infrastructure nationwide by 20.7% over a one-year period (2009-2010) and led to the reduction of one health facility serving an average of 8,000 of the population in 2006 to 5,500 in 2010.By 2017, 71% of the population lived within a 5-km radius of health facilities and County Health Teams planned, executed and constructed over 300 new facilities (Hospitals, Health Centers and Clinics,) and upgrading of others to increase to 85%.By 2018, 84% of facilities were providing the Basic Package of Health Services nationwide.There are 15 counties in Liberia and the Ministry of Health, 2006 The data shows existing facilities in counties but fails to distinguish health facilities that were constructed or rehabilitated.William V.S Tubman was the 19th president of Liberia and the longest-serving president in the country’s history; he served from his election in 1944 until hhe diedin 1971 while William RichardTolbertJr. served as the 20th president of Liberia from 1971 until 1980.Ellen Johnson Sirleaf was elected President of the Republic of Liberia in 2005 and 2011.

Lib ranks 150 in 2023, with George Weah as president.Verdict: Misleading! FIFA has no data on the claimFull Text: The name George Manneh Weah cannot be left unmentioned in the history of international football legends. The Ballon d’Or (World Best), African Best, and European Best were all bagged by him within a year.The soccer star did not only display the physique of an African footballer, but he also left a legacy that resounds with the iconic expertise that the name George Oppong Weah represents in the field of football.He raised the image of Liberian football on the world stage FIFA. Also, he took the Lonestar, the national football team of Liberia, to its first and second participation in the African Cup of Nations in 1996 and 2002, respectively.The Federation of International Football Associations (FIFA), governs football and develops the game worldwide.Fast forward, the Liberian- born soccer legend entered the game of politics in his homeland, where he is the current president of Liberia, with many expectations from Liberians, that Liberian football will boom under the one-time Ballon d’Or winner, George Weah.But posting what he claims is the failure of President George Weah in his area of expertise, football, an activist named Martin Kollie has blasted the Liberian leader for retrogressing the soccer sector, instead of elevating the game as a soccer icon.Kollie compares Liberia’s ranking in the “FIFA World Rankings” under footballing President George Weah, to 150 in 2023, and 135 out of 206, under the watch of former Vice President Joseph Boakai who was not a footballer as Weah.Verification: FIFA shows that as of December 2017, Liberia ranked 134 out of 205 countries, contrary to Martin Kollie’s claim that the country ranked 134 out of 206 nations on the FIFA World Ranking.Also, the latest 2023 record on FIFA’s World Ranking additionally displays that, as of April 2023, Liberia ranks 148 out of 211 countries.We also made efforts to check other Soccerway, which show that in 2017, Liberia ranked 148, and maintained the same in 2023. Football Transfer, a digital football platform that provides news, analysis, statistics, and histories for football’s leading clubs and players, also has statistics that Liberia ranks 148 in 2013 and 2017.Kolies’s post has so far attracted 323 reactions, 243 comments, and 42 shares as of the time it was captured by The Stage Media, with many different views being expressed about the post, as commenters like Min. Holy Ginger Fab stating, “ you cannot detach Hon. Boakai from the good of the past administration.”Another commenter, Bob Queminee stated, “the strides, and progresses under the Ellen Johnson Sirleaf (EJS) and the Joseph Nyumah Boakai (JNB) stewardship are attributed to JNB, while the failures and deficiencies are disassociated from Boakai, and EJS alone takes the blame.”Screenshot of Martin’s postKollie was also contacted to provide detailed information about his post, and also share the source of his claim, but to date, the message is yet to be responded to.Screenshot of the message sent to Martin KollieConclusion:FIFA records show Liberia ranked 134 out of 206 countries in 2017, and 148 out of 211 countries in 2023.

What we know about Motorcyclists and Tricylists in Liberia,Gloria Wleh,"Image Credit: FacebookIn the lead-up to the October 10, 2023, Presidential and Legislative Elections in Liberia, endorsement and cross carpeting from the other party to the other are on the rise.One of the said groups that have in recent times pledged their support to the election bid of former Vice President Joseph Boakai is the Federation of Motorcyclist and Tricyclist Unions of Liberia  (FOMTUL).The pronouncement was made on June 15, 2023, by the group’s president John Kenyor who told the former Vice President and stalwarts of the opposition Unity Party(UP) Liberia has over 230,000 motorcyclists and tricyclists nationwide.The figures called by Kenyor, a former supporter of the ruling Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC)-led government appears interesting, and alarming, taking into account the high number of Liberians who are operating in that sector. Kenyor was interviewed when we were alerted to a post by the former Vice President’s office staff, George  Saah.The Federation of Motorcyclist and Tricyclist Unions (FOMTUL) is a national labour federation of various unions representing the interests of motorcyclists and tricyclists across the country.The latest data obtained by our researcher from the Ministry of Transport’s Research, Statistics and Information Management Unit shows a total of 14,704 registered motorcyclists and tricycle operators in Liberia.The record says in 2022, Liberia recorded a total of 14,704 numbers of registered motorcyclists and tricyclists across the country.The amount is broken down under the “Report on Vehicle Registration for New License Plate Yearly Report January-December 2022”, and the “Report on Vehicle Registration for Annual Renewal Stickers Yearly Report January-December.”Specifically under the Category “M: Motorcycles,” in M1, M2, and M3 are the total figures 6946 accumulated for motorcyclists recorded in the country. While M4, and M5 representing 7,758 as shown in the data are said to be the numbers of tricycles in Liberia.Photo of the 2022 registrations for the new license platePhoto of the 2022 registration for annual renewal stickersSpeaking to the data obtained by this researcher, and the assertion from FOMTUL’s president that Liberia has over 230,000 motorcyclists, and tricyclists, the Assistant Director for Research, Statistics and Information Management of the Ministry of Transport, Jasper White confirmed that the data obtained by this researcher is authentic, saying, “cyclists who registered under the Ministry of Transport are those considered by the government as legitimate operators.Jasper pointed out that there are bikers who have simply registered with FOMTUL and are not recognized by the Liberian government.He said, “Any other record that does not come from the Ministry of Transport should be considered null and void.”Responding to queries from TSM on whether the numbers provided were the actual amount of cyclists Liberia has, the President of the Federation of Motorcyclist and Tricyclist Unions (FOMTUL) of Liberia said the figures announced during the endorsement of the standard bearer of the former ruling Unity Party are numbers of motorcyclists and tricyclistsregistered by the leadership of FOMTUL across the fifteen (15) counties by 2023.When asked to provide the documented data of the total number of the union had registered, Kenyor refused, saying, “I cannot make public the data recording the number of motorcyclists and tricyclists of the union.”When further asked if his refusal to make public his records could be because the union exaggerated the figure, the union’s boss responded, “If anyone doubts the numbers we have announced that have pledged support to make Amb. Joseph president comes 2023, let them watch and see during the elections.”What additionally have we established?Additionally, The Stage Media confirm that the union’s president is considering running for a representative position in Montserrado County’s district four. Kenyor is opting that the opposition Unity Party pick him as their candidate to contest on the party’s ticket and to get their fullest support.Conclusion: The government of Liberia’s latest data shows a total of 14,704 numbers of motorcyclists and tricyclists are operating in the country. Therefore, John Kenyor’s claim that Liberia has over 230,000 registered motorcyclists and tricyclists is an exaggeration!It is safe to say that we did not include the motorcyclist and tricyclists who are registered with the union since Keyor refused. At the same time, it is confirmed that the union endorsed Boakai, but there is no data to show if 230,000 endorsed him.This article will be updated once there are  additional dataThis story was produced with the Center for Journalism Innovation and Development (CJID)’s support.Related ",17/06/2023,https://tsmliberia.com/exaggerated-liberia-does-not-have-over-23000-registered-cyclists/,1
"No, Srimex was not shut down due to tax Evasion, but…",Maima Wright,"Claim: Liberia Revenue Authority Shuts down Musa Hassan Bility Oil and gas company (Srimex) as a result of tax evasion and road fund scamSource: Martin K.N KollieVerdict: Partly True, Kollie is wrong to say the business was closed for Tax Evasion but the fact is the business was closed because the institution owns revenue.Full Text: On June 6, 2023, Martin Kollie posted on his Facebook page stating that Srimex had been shut down for tax evasion.Srimex is an oil and gas company owned by businessman and politician; Musa Hassan Bility, one of the embattled political leaders of the opposition Liberty Party (LP).Bility’s institution came into conflict with the law, and actions were taken against him by the government institution responsible for tax collection in Liberia.When the action was taken, Kollie took to his Facebook page and wrote these words, “Liberia Revenue Authority Shuts down Musa Hassan Bility oil and gas company (Srimex) as a result of tax evasion and road fund scam This thing is getting serious.”Screenshot of Kollie’s postSince the post was made, it has thus far gotten the attention of two hundred thirteen(230) reactions, one hundred fourteen (140) comments and fifty-two(52) shares.Responding to the claim, Musa Bility, too, posted on his Facebook page saying, “Yes, it’s true. The LRA has shut down the only thing I’m depending on to make all the big mouths. Join me tonight at 9 pm. Let’s talk about it.”Following the post, Bility went live on his page and cleared the air saying that the LRA closed his company (Srimex) for withholding tax and income tax that the company owes. He furthered that the LRA did not give a prior notice as they usually do but they closed the company and put the notice on the door and told the management to go to LRA to resolve it. The LRA gave the company the bill of one hundred sixty-five thousand United States dollars, he further explained. He also said that it has nothing to do with tax, as Spoon FM and Martin Kollie presented the news to the public.The National Road Fund Agency was Founded in 2016 with the purpose of financing road and bridge maintenance works and directly associated planning, programming and management activities; 2. The governance and oversight of the Road Fund including the approval of the Annual Road Maintenance Expenditure Program submitted by agencies authorized to undertake road and bridge works in Liberia;And 3. An administrative structure that is capable of undertaking the core functions associated with collecting, managing and disbursing funds to and on behalf of agencies authorized to undertake road and bridge works in Liberia.Bility filed a lawsuit against the government to the Supreme Court but was withdrawn.Verification: After coming across the two claims and their usual reactions, TSM’s fact-checker reached out to Danicious Kaihenneh Sengbeh, Communication officer at the Liberia Revenue Authority to verify which action the LRA took against Bility’s Srimex.In his reply, Sengbeh said that the LRA closed Srimex because they owed taxes and not for tax evasion as was said by Kollie.Tax Evasion is defined as a person claiming tax deduction or tax credit they are not entitled to or failing to report income and concealing taxable access.Sengbe clarified that the action was taken against the company for tax delays and not against an individual. Sengbe further explained that similar actions are routinely taken against numerous companies and businesses to recover taxes.Although Sengbe could not provide specific details on the amount owed by Srimex, which is known to be owned by businessman and politician  Bility, Bility himself confirmed on a Facebook broadcast that he owes US$165,000 in taxes. While he acknowledged that it is routine for the LRA to request access to a company’s financial records to determine tax withholdings, he expressed confusion over the decision to shut down a major company like his. “I can confirm that the action was taken in line with the LRA’s mandate. The action was taken against a company that has delayed its taxes, not an individual. Similar actions are routinely taken against many other companies and businesses to recover taxes,” Bility stated.in 2016, Bility was hooked for failure to settle a US$143,000 tax bill owed to the Government of Liberia (GoL).At the same time, Bility who is contesting in Nimba refuted claims that he received $5 Million from the fund fundsConclusion: After doing all of our investigations, we determined that Kollie is incorrect in claiming that Srimex was “close to tax evasion” rather than owing taxes. In this case, Srimex is closed since the institution owns income. However, because the LRA is not the same as the National Road Fund Agency, we can conclude that the closing of Srimex had nothing to do with the road fund.This story was produced with the Center for Journalism Innovation and Development (CJID)’s support.Related ",17/06/2023,https://tsmliberia.com/no-srimex-was-not-shut-down-due-to-tax-evasion-but/,0
"Photos of prostitutes not from Nimba, Liberia",R. Joyclyn Wea,"Claim: Photo from sex workers meeting in Nimba countySource: Online ParrotVerdict: MisleadingFull Text: The post was done in pidgin English but we translated a few which state that sex workers in Nimba County say the business is giving them a hard time.We aren’t mainly focused on the content of the post but on the images used stating that those pictures were of sex workers in that County.The pidgin English version says, “Hopojoe neh in Nimba County say ley bini giving stinkaylu scent and no longer they want Monrovia kpa-kpa-kpa neh coming in their area.”It furthered, “They told the New Dawn Newspaper that they are blue and want to put an immediate end to it. According to the paper, the commercial sex workers had a long day meeting in the capital city of Nimba County and Sanniquellie respectively. As per GNN Liberia, the intent of the hopojoe neh meeting was to organize themselves and speak with one voice to warn other young girls from putting foot into their territory. They said these girls from Lofa, Bong, Grand Bassa, and especially Monrovia bamblays, are giving them too much hard time by chaklaing their business, and have threatened that no more do they want to see them stepping in their area. Or else, bamboo will divide kola. Because of these young girls, their prices have drastically reduced from US 20$ to 10$. Now sitting stinks at US 5$, especially becuh of Monrovia ten-ten neh. ?? | New Dawn Liberia @GNNLiberia#OnliineParrot”Since this check, the post has generated 200 reactions, 116 comments, and 24 shares.Sex in exchange for money is prostitution, and this act is prohibited by law in Liberia. In several towns around Liberia, including Monrovia, the action is publicly seen on street corners at night.They can be seen at entrances of entertainment centers at night, drawing the attention of males who go to those places to conduct business with them.In Liberia, prostitution is not a legal activity; the government has attempted to outlaw it and continues to do so, but their attempts have been ineffective because prostitution is still on the rise. Police frequently patrol and raid prostitution-related locations, although offenders regroup elsewhere and frequently return to the location they fled from after some time.Prostitution is illegal, but widespread in Liberia.Like its neighbour, Sierra Leone, child prostitution has seen an increase in the aftermath of the civil war.On June 7, 2023, Online Parrot, a local blog in Liberia with over 32,229 subscribers, posted a blog about a supposed gathering of prostitutes in Nimba County, one of Liberia’s largest and most populous counties in Liberia. Three pictures of the purported prostitutes were included with the post, which attracted a lot of attention and piqued our interest in checking out the pictures to confirm the claims made by the blog. We recognized that Nimba County is one of those hotspot areas for commercial sex workers in Liberia.What we discovered:Verification: Contrary to what the Online Parrot said, TSM discovered that all three photographs are not from Liberia or Nimba County, but rather are from various other nations or publications created around the world.Image from Zambian EyeThe top image, which also happens to be the first on the post, comes from an article by Phil Daka that was published on March 29, 2015, by Zambian Eye, on how churches have turned into fashion shows. New Telegraph imageThe blog’s second image is a screenshot from a story by “The New Telegraph” dated 2020 that claimed two Nigerian women had been convicted of running a prostitution ring in Ireland.The final photograph displayed above is from a piece by Temitope Adetunji that appeared on April 27, 2020, under the headline “COVID-19: task force arrests 18 Prostitutes in Ondo for Partying at Night.”What other media outlets published:In the New Dawn October 17, 2022 publication it reported that “Local sex workers in Ganta, Nimba County have threatened to drag the government to court for a poor economic environment that has reduced their customers’ inflow” with an image far different from the three used by the blog.New Dawn October 17, 2022 publication imageAgain on June 7, 2023, the paper for the second time reported about a meeting by commercial sex workers in Nimba County intended to protect their trade, which is partly what the blog used with different images to deceive the public into believing that those images are from the held meeting of the local commercial sex workers in the County. Like the previous article published by the media outlet, this publication carried a different image from what was posted by the blog.New Dawn’s image publication June 7, 2023Conclusion: Considering our research, the images posted by Online Parrot which are said to be of commercial sex workers in Nimba are misleading.This story was produced with the Center for Journalism Innovation and Development (CJID)’s support.Related ",17/06/2023,https://tsmliberia.com/photos-of-prostitutes-not-from-nimba-liberia/,0

"Koijee’s claim all opposition members are former government officials, false",The Stage Media-Liberia,"Claim: “The current opposition [members] are all former government officials,” said Jefferson Koijee, the Mayor of  Monrovia and Secretary of Mr Weah’s Congress for Democratic Change. Verdict: False. Checks by DUBAWA and interviews with some opposition members indicate that not all have been in government.
Monrovia’s Mayor Jefferson Koijee has told a gathering of intellectuals that the current opposition seeking to dethrone incumbent President Weah are all former government officials. The Mayor’s statement comes in the wake of opposition slogans that Liberia needs to be “rescued” from the hands of Mr Weah. But Mr Koijee questioned the authenticity of the different slogans claiming that the opposition members are former government officials who had the opportunity to serve but failed to deliver the country at the time of service. “Look at the current opposition; they are all former government officials. When we were in opposition, we never had former government [officials in] opposition,” said the Mayor. With five months to go for the October 10 Presidential and Legislative elections, the message for votes is taking diverse trends. The Mayor’s video has since attracted varied opinions.  Given his place as Mayor and his role in the country’s governance structure, his words and comments are important in the lead-up to the election. DUBAWA decided to investigate if all the opposition members were once government officials.  Verification
Mayor Koijee, the Secretary of the Congress for Democratic Change, a constituent party within the ruling Coalition, made the statement on Saturday, May 27, 2023, at an ‘Intellectual Center.’ He made the particular claim around the 28 mins of his assertion that spanned for 31:53sec.Government officials are people elected or appointed to administer a government. Like the “Vocabulary Dictionary,” the Free Dictionary shares the same definition.
Why is the claim important to investigate?
To serve in government is to be allowed to improve the lives of citizens. If the claim by Mayor Koijee is true, then it means all the opposition members who now seek to govern once had the opportunity to improve the people’s lives but failed to do so. So DUBAWA decided to investigate if the claim was true. When contacted, some members of the opposition community in Liberia rejected the claim from the Mayor of Monrovia and the Secretary of the CDC.Nelsco Wolo, National Vice Chairman for Mobilization and Recruitment of the Opposition Movement for Democracy and Reconstruction (MDR), is a party headed by Senator Jeremiah Koung, now a running mate to Amb. Joseph Boakai of the Unity Party clarified that he has not worked in government. In a conversation with ‘DUBAWA’, he said: “I am not a former government official; for me, I haven’t been a government official. The Mayor should be able to define his motive behind the statement.”
The opposition Unity Party National Vice Chair for Inter-Party Relations and National Elections Commission Affairs, Cornelius Kruah-Togba, in a conversation with DUBAWA, also clarified that she was neither appointed nor elected by the President nor the electorate and can, therefore, not be said to have worked in government before.
Another opposition leader, Aloysius Toe, the Secretary General of the Collaborating Political Parties (CPP), said the claim that all opposition members are former government members is untrue.
“Alexander Cummings, the leader of the CPP, has not served as a government official. I am Aloysius Toe. I am the secretary of the CPP. I have not worked in government since my existence,” said Toe. The Mayor, however, declined to substantiate his claim against the opposition members despite efforts by DUBAWA to get him to substantiate his claim. 
Conclusion
The claim by the Mayor of Monrovia that all members of the opposition in Liberia are all former governments is false!

"Unity Party exited government with 12.4% inflation, not 30% in 2017",The Stage Media-Liberia,"From DubawaClaim: “When the Unity Party was exiting in 2017, inflation was 30%,” said Randall Dobayou, a stalwart of the CDC and Deputy Director for the Environmental Protection Agency.Verdict: False. “Inflation did not hit 30% in 2017, as asserted by the speaker. Data from the World Bank, IMF and others suggest 12.44%.”Full TextThe debate surrounding the best platform to transform the country has taken centre stage on major radio platforms across Liberia as the crucial October 10 Presidential and Legislative elections draw closer.One such argument among Liberian politicians is the issue of how the economy has been managed so far and how the winner of the upcoming elections can consolidate the gains made.A stalwart of the ruling establishment and deputy director for the Environmental Protection Service,Randall Dobayou, said one of the track records of the Weah administration had been macro-economic stability.“We all saw in this country the Unity Party exit. The inflation was at 30%. Today, according to the IMF and World Bank report, inflation is 7%. So for the economy, we have already taken giant steps,” said Dobayou as he argues Weah’s government’s priority on theOK Conversation showwith two other opposition members.He made these statements during the show on Monday, May 29, 2023, just around46 mins of the program. The claimant responded directly to a question about the government’s major concerns and how unique the CDC ticket is compared to others.Due to the weight of the claim and its biting effects on citizens, DUBAWA has seen the need to fact-check the statement.VerificationInflationis a term that we use to describe rising prices. It also reflects the annual percentage change in the cost of goods and services. The consumer price index usually measures it.Before Weah’s election in 2017, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, a Havard-trained economist, presided over the country’s leadership. According to world bank data,inflation in 2017 stood at 12.4%.Also, the International Monetary Fund data for Liberia’s inflation indicate that in 2017 the inflation rate was12.4%.Other data sources like‘Statista’,macrotrendshave on their separate websites12.44% and12.42as Liberia’s inflation rate for the year 2017.However, Checks by DUBAWA indicate that Liberia’s current inflation is6.9 or 7%.ConclusionFindings show that the assertion that Liberia’s inflation was 30% in 2017 is false.Related ",02/06/2023,https://tsmliberia.com/unity-party-exited-government-with-12-4-inflation-not-30-in-2017/,0

Was Maritime Boss Eugene Nagbe Right on these Claims?,R. Joyclyn Wea,"Verification: On 17th May 2023, The Stage Media received a request from the Daily Observer Newspaper, one of Liberia’s widely read newspapers.

The institution asked TSM to assist in fact-checking the truthfulness and accuracy of some of the claims made by Eugene Lenn Nagbe, Commissioner General of the Liberia Maritime Authority when he appeared on ELBC Wednesday, May 17, 2023, to promote the agenda of President George Weah. The interview attracted 242 reactions, 487 comments, 201 shares and 7.2k views. We immediately commenced research on a few claims made by Nagbe.

 “We have over five thousand vessels on our water flying our flag.”
“Nyonblee endorses Boakai five times: 2005, 2011, and 2023.”
Direct Foreign Investment from partners has been Cut off. There’s no budget support from the US government and EU like we used to have before, it is based on the collection per month that we make payment. 
Inflation reduced from 23% in 2018 to 6.9 % under President Weah.
Liberia’s foreign reserves increase is over 27%
Liberia Inflation rate:

Liberia’s current inflation rate is put at 9.49% as of December 2022, therefore the minister understated the figure.


Are the EU and US Governments not Contributing to Liberia’s budget: 

Vessels on Liberia waters:

On the issue of about five thousand vessels flying the Liberian water, the Commissioner over-stated the number. Liberia currently has 4295 commercial ships operating under its flagship and 268 additional ships registered as of 2022.

We find no record to confirm the Minister’s claim on Senator Nyonblee Multiple Endorsements or support for former Vice President Joseph Boakai’s candidacy.

The only record that exists is the recent endorsement of the Boakai and Koung ticket in Grand Bassa County. Grand Bassa County Senator Nyonblee Karnga-Lawrence, who took the bold step during an elaborate and well-organized endorsement ceremony held Sunday, May 14, 2023, in Buchanan, Grand Bassa County, said she chose to endorse the Boakai-Koung ticket instead of serving as Vice President to Mr Alexander Cummings because of the duplicitous role that the Alternative National Congress (ANC) played in destabilizing her political institution.

Liberia Foreign Reserved:

Foreign exchange reserves consist of foreign currency, deposits denominated in foreign currency, Monetary Gold, Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) and Reserve position in the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Foreign exchange reserves are held by monetary authorities to finance trade imbalances, check the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations and address other issues under the purview of the central bank.

The average value for Liberia during that period was 0.24 billion U.S. Dollars with a minimum of 0 billion U.S. Dollars in July 1996 and a maximum of 0.69 billion U.S. Dollars in March 2022. Click on the following link to see the values of Foreign exchange reserves, billion currency units around the world.


Data obtained from the world bank also puts Liberia’s total reserves including gold, and current US$ at 340,965,881 (340.97).

No direct foreign support to Liberia:

Foreign direct investment:

Foreign direct investment and net inflows (% of GDP) in Liberia were reported at 1.3018 % in 2021, according to the World Bank collection of development indicators, compiled from officially recognized sources. Foreign direct investments are the net inflows of investment to acquire a lasting management interest (10 per cent or more of voting stock) in an enterprise operating in an economy other than that of the investor.

It is the sum of equity capital, reinvestment of earnings, other long-term capital, and short-term capital as shown in the balance of payments. 

A budget is a financial plan for a specified period. It is an estimate of expenses a party will incur, usually broken out by category, to provide a roadmap that the party should follow.


Liberia’s development partners contribute funds to help achieve the Government’s national development objectives. For FY2023, total donor spending is projected to be US$211.3 million of which the United States government is expected to contribute 6.7 million in aid.

A message from Finance Minister Samuel Tweah in the citizen guide spells out a partner or foreign contributions to the national budget and how funds are allocated to line ministries and agencies. “In this Draft National Budget of FY2023, your government expects to collect a total of US$777.9 million in revenue, of which US$110.00 million is expected to come from our development partners as on-budget support.”

Journey to 30% Women’s Political Representation in 2023 Elections Achievable?,Gloria Wleh,"Liberia has over the years seen many calls coming from different national and international groupings for the equal participation of women in decision-making, especially in politics.Despite signing many regional and international Protocols such as the ratification of the 1979 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) and its Optional Protocol, the Adoption of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action; and the Ratification of the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa, Liberian women are still lagging when it comes to politic.Notwithstanding, the fact that Liberia was the first African country to elect a female president in 2006 and currently has a female Vice President, gender parity still seems to be a challenge.A UNDP report of 2022 ranked Liberia as “156th of 162nd countries on the Gender Inequality Index, and 163 out of 185 countries on the list of women in parliaments”. The report further noted that Liberian women make up less than 11% of the 103 seats in the Legislature.In February 2022, “An Act to Amend Certain Sections of the New Election Law (1986) As Amended Through 2014” was passed by the Legislature.In March this year (2023), President George Weah vetoed several Sections of that Bill but approved amongst others, Section 4.5 b and c which state, “a political party, or coalition in its submission to the Commission, of its list of candidates for an election, should endeavour to ensure that the governing body and its list of candidates have no less than 30% of its members from each gender.”“A list of candidates submitted to the Commission for an election should endeavour to have no less than 30% of the candidates on the list from each gender,” accordingly.With the approval of this Section into law by the President of Liberia, the National Elections Commission (NEC) and twenty-five (25) registered political parties held a signing ceremony of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between political parties and the NEC for the full implementation of a minimum 30% gender quota for candidates listings in the 2023 general elections.When quizzed whether the Act approved by President Weah was not enough to achieve the 30% quota, the NEC Director of Communication Henry Flomo responded: “Well, if there was a law, there would not be a need to sign the MOU,” indicating uncertainty about the implementation of the Law.But during the signing ceremony on May 11, 2023, foreign and regional partners, including Ireland, Sweden, UN Women, European Union, UNDP, and ECOWAS among others, lauded the political parties for the step taken to ensure that the 30% quota is put into effect, and called on all political parties to “turn the 30% quota MOU from paper into reality”.At the ceremony, NEC Chairperson, Madam Davidetta Brown Lassanah indicated that the signing of the MOU was a holistic display of a firm commitment to the inclusion of women in the new political environment.Madam Brown Lassanah pledged her institution’s commitment to the MOU saying, “Liberia is at a crossroads and by the signing of the MOU between political parties and the NEC, the NEC reaffirms its commitment to changing the current narrative of inequality in Liberia’s politics, to increasing the participation of women as candidates in the 2023 presidential and legislative elections”.The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) seeks, among other things, to create an enabling environment, and a safe space for female contestants, but most importantly, candidate listings submitted to the NEC should have a minimum of 30% of either gender for the 2023 general and presidential elections.Speaking on behalf of the men from the various political parties at the signing ceremony, the Chairman of the Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC), Mulbah Morlu vowed to give the MoU their fullest support, stating, “We are taking a practical approach to the full implementation of Section 4.5 of the New Elections Law of Liberia; and we assure you of our commitments, which will be demonstrated at the national, electoral and the structural levels of our different political organizations.Related ",23/05/2023,https://tsmliberia.com/journey-to-30-womens-political-representation-in-2023-elections-achievable/,0
Explainer: The “CDC” Howe’s WhatsApp Message Regarding PYJ’s Church Saga,R. Joyclyn Wea,"About Aloysius Howe:Howe is the Special Assistant and Media Aid to Liberia’s Finance Minister, Samuel D. Tweah. He is also a member of the Congress for Democratic Change, one of the constituency parties within the ruling establishment (Coalition for Democratic Change). Howe was accused of allegedly withdrawing 160k from the Liberia Institute of Statistics and Geo-Information Services ( LISGIS) account on October 19, 2022, on Cheque tee– BG CHK330, Ref. J01CQWL222920084.Liberia’s Finance Minister Samuel D. Tweah, who is the chairman of the Board of Directors of LISGIS confirmed LISGIS paid Howe US$160 thousand for his (Howe) Public Relations services he allegedly provided to the institution.Picture Credit: Social Media  (Samuel Tweah and Aloysius Howe)In March of this year, Howe was reportedly attacked by students of theUniversity of Liberia particularly members of the Students Unification Party (SUP) in which he sustained injuries when he had gone to see Joseph Blama, a lecturer at that government-run university. Howe said on Facebook that he thinks his connection to the government led to the attack on him.Sunday’s FracasSunday, members of Senator Prince Johnson’s Christ Chapel of Faith Ministry were forced to escape for safety when a youth group operating under the name National Patriotic Party (NPP) Youth Council attacked the church’s grounds while yelling “War Crimes Court.”A situation that created fear in members of the Church thus forcing them to run for safety.The group has allegedly gone in defence of Vice President, Jewel Howard Taylor who was expecting a response from Senator Prince Y. Johnson whom she [ VP Howard-Taylor] has had a soured relationship with recently.The Nimba County Senator had last week invited Liberians to gather at his church on Sunday, where he promised to respond to Vice President Jewel Howard-Taylor, who had called him a “killer” earlier in the week during a program held by Legislative staffers in the joint chambers of the Capitol Building in support of President George Weah.Before the ceremony on Sunday, the Nimba Senator told his audience that he had received information suggesting that “hooligans” from the CDC, were nearby and intended to attack him and disturb the event.Leaked WhatsApp MessageA leaked WhatsApp message from Howe, a Special Assistant to Finance and Development Planning Minister Samuel Tweah, urged members of CDC to falsely blame the Unity Party for the attack on Senator Prince Johnson’s Church, went viral on social media on May 22, 2023.Howe said in the WhatsApp message, “The party needs to have a press conference and accuse the unity party of masterminding what happened today at PYJ church, accuse them of being the one who placed people in CDC paraphernalia to create chaos and make it appear like it is the CDC who sent him.”What we foundThe Stage Media Liberia-TSM placed a WhatsApp message to Howe, he confirmed the number is his, but claimed the WhatsApp is fake and he responded to the message.Aloysius Howe “Thanks for reaching out. This was brought to my attention yesterday and I was shocked. I provided clarity on it for public consumption. Please see below ????. “The folks from the unity party need to do better. Their actions to have created a fake WhatsApp message in my name with reference that we want our party (CDC) to do a press conference and accuse them of being the one who masterminded what happened this morning at PYJ church is clowney.Whoever sat behind the computer or a smartphone to programme such is brainless, mindless and foolish, and the viral manner in which key officials from the unity party are posting it on their social media pages is evident that these folks lack strategies for the upcoming election and are chewing on every insignificant thing.Howe said the message has no connection to him “That WhatsApp message is fake and has absolutely no connection to me. At no time did I say anything of such or write anything of that kind in any chat room.“According to Howe; a fake WhatsApp page can be created: “Hey, even I here can use your number and create a fake WhatsApp message. “I am not saying that the number is not mine, of course, it is mine but that message is not real.”The picture on his WhatsApp profile matches the one on the group conversation but Howe claimed the message is fraudulent.We also look into the mobile money registration that was made, and it is established that Howe is the owner of the number attached to the Whatsapp message.To find out if Howe’s allegation was true and whether two individuals could share a cell number, we contacted Tarloe Yardanmah, an IT specialist.“It is impossible,” Tarloe said. He claims that a single mobile user may get sim cards from the same GSM provider under many identities but with the same picture and different mobile numbers. He asserts that it is also feasible to register a mobile device in someone’s name without using that person’s phone number. In response to the question about WhatsApp groups, Tarrloe stated that a person must be a member of the group to access it. This implies that the group administrator must add you to a social media group like WhatsApp. He stated that someone can send a message to their WhatsApp contact using another person’s phone without that person knowing, but this is not the case.Related ",22/05/2023,https://tsmliberia.com/explainer-the-cdc-howes-whatsapp-message-regarding-pyjs-church-saga/,0
"No record that Liberia’s Maritime Registry is the “BEST” Worldwide, But…",R. Joyclyn Wea,"Claim: Liberia Maritime is the second and best registry in the world.Source: LNTV Liberia LIVEVerdict: Liberia Maritime Registry is the Second in the world, but not the best.Full Text: “I have to be very fair, I inherited from Dr. Kollie a very solid program. The maritime program was very strong, so I have been building upon what I met to make it stronger. So currently, our Registry, the Liberian Registry, is the second in the world and the best in the world. and when I took over Mr. President gave me the mandate to ensure that Liberia again becomes the number one registry in the world. And I have been working hard to ensure that as a result of that, we are climbing and climbing and the Liberian flag on the ship is being flagged very high.”The live interview attracted 242 reactions, 487 comments, 201 shares, and 7.2K viewers.Verification: on 17th May 2023, The Stage Media received a request from the Daily Observer Newspaper, one of Liberia’s widely read newspapers.The institution asked TSM to assist in fact-checking the truthfulness and accuracy of some of the claims made by Eugene Lenn Nagbe, commissioner general of the Liberia Maritime Authority when he appeared on ELBC Wednesday, May 17, 2023, to promote the agenda of President George Weah. We immediately commenced research on one of the claims he made and found that he was correct about Liberia’s Maritime Registry being the second in the world, but not the best registry in the world.The Liberian Registry, established in 1948 by former U.S. Secretary of State Edward Stettinius, is recognized as one of the foremost open ship and corporate registries. During the past 61 years, the country’s commitment to safe shipping has remained steadfast. The Liberian Registry is a sovereign maritime jurisdiction responsible for the registration, regulatory enforcement, and safety of ocean-going ships. The Registry establishes identification details for ships and records legally enforceable documents, such as mortgages and bills of sale.The Registry is also responsible for the enforcement of maritime treaties, including Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS); Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL); and the Standards for Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW). The Ship Registry runs in parallel with the Liberian Corporate Registry, which performs the same functions as the corporate registration service of any other government.It is established that Liberia is the second among the top ten largest flag states in the shipping industry as of April 2022. The Republic of Liberia has 4295 commercial ships operating under its flagship including 268 additional ships registered under this Flag of convenience making it the fastest-growing flag state for two consecutive years, 2019 and 2020. It achieved a 9.3% growth worth 188 million gross tons as per Lloyd’s List intelligence data.Clarkson’s World Fleet Monitor showed that from December 2020, Liberia outran all the open registries and grew at a pace of 8.6%, evident in the shipping market as it attracted many shipowners from Greece, Japan, China, Singapore, and the United States. Hence, flag transfer tonnage accounted for 60% of its growth.Liberia finishes off 2020 as the world’s fastest-growing flag State for the second year in a row. In late 2018 Liberia became the second-largest flag State in the world, and since then, has continued to lead the world in fleet growth for two straight years.We find that the Panama Marine Authority is the world’s largest flag state. Panama is a small nation of 3 million people bordering the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean. Only one shipping company is operational in the country; however, it is the largest flag state in the world with 9596 vessels sailing under its flag. Panama’s strategic location amidst crucial maritime trade routes connecting the Pacific and Atlantic oceans through the Panama Canal allows it to have an eminent position in the world trade network.Most commercial ships sailing under the Panamanian flag are owned by foreigners desiring to avoid the strict maritime trade regulations of their home countries. Since Panama has an open registry, the shipowners can register easily, avoid paying income tax, employ cheap labor, and earn high profits.Panama has been ranked as the top flag state in the world in 2020 according to Lloyd’s List Intelligence data. It recorded a remarkable 4.4 % growth amounting to 235 million gross tonnes compared to 2019. Around 16 per cent of the global shipping fleet is sailing under its flagship, more than the combined fleets of the US and China.Conclusion: While it is true that Liberia’s Maritime Registry is the second in the world and top performing, the Minister got his facts wrong when he said Liberia’s Maritime Registry is the “ BEST” in the world. We could not find any record or information to confirm the Minister’s claim that the Liberian Maritime Registry is the BEST in the world.This story was produced with the Center for Journalism Innovation and Development (CJID) support.Related ",22/05/2023,https://tsmliberia.com/no-record-that-liberias-maritime-registry-is-the-best-worldwide-but/,0
"False: Franck Kessi, a player for Barcelona, didn’t contact the Daily...",Hannah N. Geterminah,"Claim: Franck has sent a message to Liberia Daily Observer that he will be in Liberia by November of this year.
Source: Liberian History 
Verdict: Incorrect
 Full Text: Social media has an attraction after an elderly woman’s appearance on OK FM‘s afternoon Talk-Show claiming that she’s the biological mother of Franck Yannick Kessie, a player of FC Barcelona.
According to those social media posts, Nancy is seeking to reunite with her son whom she reportedly lost contact with since his childhood.
Those social media reports claimed that since  Franck’s father, Bruno Nyanway, took him and his younger brother for schooling in Ivory Coast, she has never been able to see them. 
Since that appearance, Liberians have grown concerned as different blogs have posted different information.
T. Kla Wesley Jr., a Facebook user with one hundred and thirty-one has his share of the conversation.
As for BK Medi’a post on Liberian Influence, they said Barcelona have immediately suspended Franck Yannick Késsié from all activities until he can settle things with his biological mother from Liberia. 
Also, the Liberian Music industry accused the old lady of telling lies. There are too many claims and counterclaims popping out. The one we are currently verifying was made by Liberian History.
In that post, the blog said, “Finally Franck has sent a message to the Liberia Daily Observer that he will be in Liberia by November of this year to meet Ma Nancy for a DNA test to Know whether Ma Nancy is his biological mother.” The post attached 123 comments and 274 reactions within two hours.  
Verification: The Stage Media verified two of those claims starting with his communication sent to the Daily Observer about his coming to Liberia in November of this year.
TSM-Liberia contacted Daily Observer Editor-in-Chief, Robin Dopoe Jr. and Deputy Editor, William Q. Harmon via Facebook Messenger to verify the claim that the Liberian Observer has received a communication from the footballer. Harmon said the player has not reached out to the Daily Observer Newspaper as claimed by Liberian History. “No one has contacted us about the player’s decision to come to Liberia; that information is fake. If the blog is claiming that the  Daily Observer has said information, why did they not share the link to the story?” he questioned. As for Dopeo, the Editor-In-Chief, he said, “I have not received any communication to that effect. I check our social media accounts and our official email, but no such information is posted, sent, or published.
The Daily Observer editor described the post as a ‘lie’ from a blog that wants to use the Daily Observer to share disinformation and gain relevance, something Dopeo said is wrong.
Relating to his football Club, FC Barcelona suspending him, we checked the Club’s website but did not see anything that talks about the action against him for neglecting his mother. 
All of the most recent information about the baller on the Club’s page happened long before the lady claiming to be his biological mother appeared on OK fm.
Screenshot of FC Barcelona’s official website. 
Conclusion: TSM-Liberia has determined that those claims are entirely untrue and should not be taken seriously after interacting with those editors and verifying the FCB website.

Janjay Baikpeh was indeed sick but they dismissed the claim of him coming down with a stroke.Journalist Garway stated that the Superintendent was last seen in public during the just-ended cabinet retreat in Grand Bassa County and was in good health from his physical appearance that day.We also visited the Facebook page of the superintendent with the hope of seeing recent information from him about the ongoing claim of him being down with a stroke, but nothing was seen posted by him denying or confirming his ill health.The only recent post of the Superintendent only said, “God is great!”Conclusion: Following our verification, TSM can safely say that the superintendent is indeed faced with some health issues.

21 Liberian Journalists Attend Two Days Fact-Checking Masterclass,The Stage Media-Liberia,"Africa Check in partnership with The Stage Media Liberia has trained 21 Liberian journalists in fact-checking. These 21 journalists were selected from three of Liberia’s 15 counties: Montserrrado, Margibi and Grand Bassa.The two-day fact-checking and verification masterclass for Journalists 2023 is a US State Department Funded project implemented by Africa Check in collaboration with the Stage Media-Liberia.The training which commenced from May 8-9; focuses on understanding how and why false information spreads, identify false information online, using online verification and geolocation tools to verify the origin of photos and videos  and knowing where and how to find data that can be used to verify the accuracy of information among others.The masterclass was being facilitated by Ms. Cayley Clifford, Africa Check Deputy Editor. She told participants about the  importance of getting their facts right as journalists.Ms. Clifford provided participants with tips for determining misinformation and disinformation online and how those claims can be checked.According to her, there are more verifying tools that that can be used to for fact-checking pointing out that some of those tools are more sophisticated than the other therefore, it is important to use what gives one the answer they seek.“If you can’t find anything online, and you’ve reached out to experts and authorities, write what you have. In that case, you may want to manually do your search” she said.Cayley furthered: “You don’t necessarily need tools to do a fact-check. Just from paying keen observations on every bit of details that is in the video, or on a picture, you can do a fact-check.”She advised journalists to always follow the golden rule adding, “If it sounds too good to be true, leave it. Always make sure your information is coming from a trusted source.”She also cautions the paticipants not to settle for the first answer or result instead, they should always dig deeper if they can.At the sametime, Bettie Johnson Mbayo, Co-Partner of The Stage Media explained her share of experience in fact-checking.Madam Mbayo believes that journalists should take advantage of the training knowing that fact-checking is important more as Liberia poised to have it’s much anticipated October 2023 Election.She encouraged the participants to take verification seriously before publishing information. “The Stage Media is not training Journalists for attraction, but to build their skills to go back to their respective instutions and get rid of misinformation and disinformation,” Mbayo noted.Many of the participants  did not have any previous knowlede about fact-checking, while some of them thinks it’s time consuming and a waste of one’s energy.“When I see photos to verify them; it used to be a problem, but i can now verify them because of this training, Journalist Oretha Bundoo Seh of ECOWAS Radio said in an interview after the training.“As a newspaper journalist, I thought it wasn’t important to fact-check photos I used on my stories, but from this training I understand that it is important, and moving forward, I am going to practice that.” Leila B. Gbati another particpant and a Journalist with the Women Voices Newspaper.“I used to think that being the first to break the news makes you a better journalist. But I now know that getting the facts right is what makes you a better journalist.” Ayouba Dukuly of Voice of Voiceless online TV said.Nemenlah Cyrus Harmon of Spoon Network said, “Prior to this gathering, I used to think fact-checking was that difficult. But given the knowledge, the tools I now have, I can say it’s easy to be done.”For Olivia Banwon of Truth FM she said, “I never used to think fact-check was very important in reporting as a journalist, but going forward, I’m going to get engaged with verifying the facts.”The Stage Media (TSM) is Liberia’s first fact-checking media institution with the overarching vision of mitigating misinformation and disinformation.Since its establishment in 2020, The Stage Media – Liberia has collaborated and nurtured partnerships that espoused the values of tackling misinformation and disinformation while bringing to light untold stories of survivors of (abuse or civil war) and ensuring that the powerful and elites are held accountable.Africa Check on the other hand is the continent’s first independent non-profit fact-checking organization, supported by philanthropic organizations and individual donors.It was established in South Africa in 2012.

TSM verify the worth of Simone Biles’s dress, shoes and the net worth of her spouse. TSM research finds that the blogs are correct about the cost of Simone Biles’s wedding dress and shoes. The gymnast, 26, and the football star, 27, officially became husband and wife on Saturday, April 22, 2023, exchanging their vows during an intimate ceremony held at a Texas courthouse while surrounded by their close friends and family. Our search also established that the 27-year-old athlete has a net worth of $7 million, although there are some reports that his net worth goes up to $50 million. Back in 2020, he signed a two-year contract with the Texans with a value of $1,390,000. His annual salary stands at $695,000 while earning a base salary of $780,000. There is no information on endorsement deals being signed by the player as of right now.Conclusion: Before her civil wedding to NFL star Jonathan Owens, Biles claims she ordered her $120 dress and AMAZON shoes. The 26-year-old gymnast was dressed in a white outfit with low neckline and frills. She stated that she purchased the garment from a small online vendor days before for $120. She had to get a different pair of shoes because the ones she had bought on Amazon were uncomfortable.Related ",08/05/2023,https://tsmliberia.com/true-gymnast-simone-biles-courthouses-wedding-is-worth-us-120/,1
What we Know about Speaker Chambers Money?,Mark Mengonfia,"Wednesday, May 3, 2023, social media (Facebook) had claims from different bloggers and even journalists that the Speaker Bhofal Chambers, House of Representatives, was sharing money in Maryland.Laso Kromah wrote “ Wow So surprise !!!!! Speaker of the house of representatives sharing money like this? 
I WILL TALK IT” Also, Fedel Saydee, a Liberian journalist with 12 thousand followers on Facebook wrote as I interpret.
“You all have been asking where the money they printed went and why we are still receiving mutilated money?
Here are some! It is in a basket and on the table in Maryland County. Ellen people did the same, and Weah people did it, we are not sure after Weah whether others won’t do it…….”Although Saydee has taken down the post, a screenshot which was taken 28 minutes after he posted attracted many. Screenshot of the Journalist’s post which he took down afterwards  Image of the Speaker turning over the money to the women has been trending since it was first posted on May 3, 2023. Midfield Deco also wrote, “ Liberia’s Speaker of the House buying votes in Maryland County.” 
Who is Speaker Chambers?  Speaker Chambers is the first among equals of 73 Representatives, a body that is clothed with the responsibilities of Lawmaking, Oversight, and Representation.
He has represented Maryland Maryland County District Two since 2006. He became the Speaker of that August body in January 2018 till present. The Speaker of the House of Representatives operated on the budget of 1,485, 164 for 2020-2021 and 2,094,425 in 2022. Speaker’s Budget on the Ministry of Finance website Verification: The Stage Media Liberia  (TSM) contacted Robert Haynes, Director of Press, House of Representatives, to verify the claims. Haynes in response to TSM-Liberia’s inquiry said the Speaker was responding to a request made by some market women in Maryland.
According to Haynes, the Speaker has gone to empower the group of women who are operating a village savings loan. He added that the Speaker provided the sum of three hundred thousand Liberian Dollars (L$ 300, 000. 00) to the women’s group. 
The full text of his reply via messenger reads, “ The Speaker, upon request of local market women in Hospital camp, Maryland County for their village saving loan and empowerment, had gone to empower the women with three hundred thousand Liberian Dollars to start or grow their businesses.”
The Director’s clarification that the money was a kind gesture from Chambers to the women is understandable that a man who has worked for those many years, the above-mentioned amount is years, it is a drop in the ocean for such an individual who even has an annual budget to operate. However, the claim that it is some of the new banknotes that were printed is true. 
All of the money in the basket and on the table are brand-new banknotes that have never been used. It is also safe to say that those women were paid to play the political game as posters bearing the image of the Speaker  were seen on the walls and in the hands of another person not very far from the Chambers in the background.
Conclusion: TSM-Liberia can not independently verify if the money was three hundred thousand Liberian Dollars as claimed by Haynes. We can not also verify the claim that the money was given to market women for business purposes so, in this case, we say unverified.

"Did 1,221 People Win 2023 Diversity Visa Program in Liberia?",R. Joyclyn Wea,"Claim:  1,221 people win DV in Liberia  Source: Shine Liberia  Verdict: the blog is correct about the number of people who won the 2022/2023 DV in Liberia. Full Text: A social media blog, Shine Liberia posted this, “DV result, Congratulations to all the 1,221 persons who were successful.” The post attracted 838 comments, 78 shares and 855 reactions.
The Immigration Act of 1990 established the Diversity Visa (DV) program, where 55,000 immigrant visas would be available in an annual lottery, starting in fiscal year 1995.
The lottery aims to diversify the immigrant population in the United States, by selecting applicants mostly from countries with low rates of immigration to the United States in the previous five years.
The Trump administration imposed the rule so that the people applying for the Diversity Visa Program would have to submit their valid passports during the application process. As a result, people in low-income countries could not apply because passports were challenging to obtain and expensive. Due to the implementation of the passport rule, the number of applicants for the Diversity Visa Program was reduced by 50% in 2019, 2020, and 2021 and aspiring immigrants from Africa suffered the most because of this rule.
In 2022, a US Judge Timothy J. Kelly has rejected the previous government’s passport rule, according to which a passport was necessary for applying for the Diversity Visa Program.
The judge granted the motion and declared that the passports were no longer necessary for the upcoming Diversity Immigrant Visa Program in 2022 (DV-2024)
Verification: we checked the information and found that the 1,221 people from liberia did turnout successfully in the just ended DV . The following chart shows how many people from various countries were selected as winners of the DV-Lottery in 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2016:

Did Senator Johnson say only the Unity Party can redeem Liberia?,R. Joyclyn Wea,"Claim: Senator Prince Johnson says it is only the Unity Party that can redeem Liberia.  Source: Shine Liberia  Judgment: False 
Full Text: As the debate for who will be named as running mate to Joseph N. Boakia parade on social media and who is capable of replacing George M. Weah, Liberians have been concerned thus taking to social media with different claims. Among these claims, Shine Liberia, a blog with 145 thousand followers on Sunday, April 23, 2023, quoted  Senator Prince Johnson as saying, “It is only the Unity Party that can redeem Liberia from George Weah’s missile.”  The claim furthered that Prince Y. Johnson Vows to support Unity Standard bearer. “Unity Party, a major opposition political party that has ruled Liberia for two successful terms under the stewardship of former President, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf is yet to announce its vic presidental pick. The party was defeated in the 2017 elections by Liberia’s footballing President, Weah. it is only Unity Party that can redeem Liberia from George Weah’s misrule ~ Prince Y. Johnson Vows to support Unity Standard bearer, seven days before UP’s official announcement for the Vice Running mate to VP Joseph N. Boakai Shine Liberia, why do you think Weah’s political ally is refusing to support him? Is it because Weah is looting the Country? Or is it that Sen. Johnson simply supporting UP because Weah refused to give him the money he requested as usual?” The post had received 200 reactions, 170 comments and 21 shares of the time of our check.
Verification: We checked Senator Johnson’s official Facebook page and found nothing of such, we also checked the Pepper Bird page where most of his messages are aired and found nothing. We came across a live press conference held at the Nimba County Senator’s home the same day the claim was posted by the blog. In that live press conference, Senator Johnson was heard rallying citizens, particularly Nimbains, to support the Unity Party regardless of who it prefers as a vice-running mate in the pending elections.
Conclusion: There is nowhere in the Sunday,  April 23, 2023, a live video of the Nimba County Senator describing former VP Boakai, the one who will redeem Liberian from Weah’s missile.  This claim that quoted PYJ as saying , “It is only the Unity Party that can redeem Liberia from George Weah’s missile” is Incorrect.",28/04/2023,https://tsmliberia.com/did-senator-johnson-say-only-the-unity-party-can-redeem-liberia/,0

Explainer: Does Weah have the Power to Impeach Judge Gbeisay?,The Stage Media-Liberia,"Claim: President Weah wants Judge Gbeisay impeach
A Facebook user, Laso Kromah took to his social media page and posted that Liberian President, George M Weah wants to impeach Associate Supreme Court Justice Yamie Gbeisay.
TSM reached out to him to get from the social media user the source of his information. In response, he only replied, “ Time will tell.”When TSM asked further, “Is there a link to support the claim?” Kromah agan didn’t answer. The post was shared multiple times and it has thus far gotten eleven reactions and seventeen comments. Gbeisay was appointed in September 2022 and was commissioned in January 2023; he is now the fifth justice of the Supreme Court of Liberia. Is there precedent case?
In Liberia, a sitting Assistant Supreme Court justice, Kabinah Ja’neh was impeached by members of the LiberianLegislature. The request for impeachment originated from Montserrado County District #8 lawmaker,  Acarous Moses Gray who chairs the Houses Committee on Executive and from the Ruling Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC). The process of impeachment went on for weeks and a final ruling was made,but it was questioned by Liberians and some of the very lawmakers from the Liberian Senate who publicly showed their opposition.
On the other hand, the man who was impeached, Kabinah Ja’neh, did not accept the ruling from the Supreme Court of Liberia. He spoke of irregularities during his impeachment process. Ja’neh then took an appeal to the ECOWAS Court for redress, a request which was granted him by that regional Court.
The ECOWAS Court mandated the government of Liberia to pay the sum of Two-Hundred Thousand (200,000.00) United States Dollars to former Associate Justice, Kabinet Ja’neh for what it called “wrongfully” impeaching him; said money and the mandate from that ECOWAS Court are yet to be obeyed by the Liberian Government.
Verification:Article 42 of Liberia’s 1986 Constitution titled impeachment states that, “The power to prepare a bill of impeachment is vested solely in the house of representative and the power to try all impeachments is vested solely in the senate.
“When the president, vice president or an associate justice of the supreme court is to be tried, the chief justice shall preside; when the chief justice or judge of a subordinate court of record is to be tried, the president of the senate shall preside. No person shall be impeached, but by the concurrence of two-thirds of the total membership of the senate.!
“Judgment in such cases, shall not extend beyond removal from office or disqualification  to hold public office in the republic, but the party may be tried at law for the same offense. The legislature shall prescribe the procedure for impeachment proceedings which shall be in conformity with the requirements of due process of law.”
Interpreting this provision of the law, Cllr. Amara Sheriff, a Liberian Lawyer said the president has no such power to impeach a justice or judge of a court of records even though he appoints them.
“It is not near possible for a president to take such a decision; by the time you appoint the person it will be finished. You cannot appoint a justice or judge because he or she does not support you and you say you want to impeach them. The whole issue with impeachment is done by the house (legislature) based upon substantial evidence or proof as in the case of Judge Richards Klah, former Commercial Court Judge.
Judge Klah resigned while the legislature was in the process of impeaching him for ethical misconduct. The house of Representative can begin an impeachment proceeding of a Judge or Justice for a cause that runs contrary to his or her duty, while the house of senate preside over the trial as jurors of the fact where both accused and accuser will face each other.
Sheriff added: “Impeachment is premised upon proven  misconduct, but not based on President Weah’s wish to impeach a  judge or justice.”
Conclusion: No, the power to impeach a Judge or Justice does not lie with the president, rather the Liberian Legislature. It begins with the House of Representatives and ends with the Senate. Therefore, the claim by Laso Kromah that President Weah wants to impeach the judge of the Supreme Court bench is Incorrect.",24/04/2023,https://tsmliberia.com/explainer-does-weah-have-the-power-to-impeach-judge-gbeisay/,0
Tales of Liberia’s 2023 Biometric Registration Process,The Stage Media-Liberia,"In 2005, Liberia was one of the first countries in West Africa to introduce the manual Optical Mark Recognition (OMR) system in elections.
OMR reads and captures data marked on a particular type of document form. In most instances, this form consists of a bubble or a square filled in as part of a test or survey. This was the system that was used during Liberia’s elections.
As the country goes to the polls on October 10, 2023, the voter’s registration is being conducted through a biometric voter registration (BVR) system, migrating from the manual Optical Mark Recognition (OMR).
The BVR is the process by which people are enlisted onto a voter registration by submitting information that includes their biometrics such as iris, face, and fingerprints. The technology is deployed to detect voter fraud, such as duplicate registrations. The BVR process started on March 20, 2023, and is expected to run in two phases until May 11, 2023.  Phase one of the registration exercise kickstarted on March 20, for twenty-one days, in six of the country’s fifteen counties, including; Bomi, Gbarpolu, Grand Bassa, Grand Cape Mount, Margibi, and Montserrado Counties. 
Phase two will run from April 21, 2023, to May 11, 2023, in the remaining nine counties, including Bong, Grand Gedeh, Grand Kru, Lofa, Maryland, Nimba, River Cess, River Gee, and Sinoe Counties.
As the National Election Commission (NEC) takes the BVR to remote villages, many Liberians, including politicians, have expressed fear because there have been a lot of complaints from day one of the registration processes. The fear of NEC’s inability to conduct the BVR existed before the process because the commission was unprepared to use the introduced system. However, NEC ignored these calls and started the BVR process. Since the beginning of the BVR in those first counties, citizens have expressed disappointment over the slow procedure. An extension was requested by both politicians and ordinary citizens but was denied by the NEC Chairperson, who insisted that the process would go on as planned.Joseph N. Boakai, political leader of the opposition Unity Party, during the signing of the Farmington River Declaration to support peaceful elections in Liberia, spoke about reports of technical problems that were causing delays in the registration process.
Among those problems, Boakai named printers assigned to registration centers going off frequently,  shortage of cards used to produce voter ID cards, and the time it takes the solar panel to generate power from the sun. He said, “The above factors are leading to a long stay in queues without registration of people who want to register and participate in the determination of the country’s next leader. Some have even hinted that they are tired and may not return to the registration centers.” “We call on the National Elections Commission to consider extending the registration process in the first six counties. This is intended to make up for the delays and technical problems that have led to many not being able to register. Not doing so will be an act of deliberately disenfranchising Liberian citizens from participating in the elections,” Boakai stressed.
Contrary to Boakai’s accusation, Davidetta Brown-Lassanah, NEC Chairperson, has expressed optimism in the BVR exercise, despite the process’s challenges.
According to Brown-Lassanah, the start of everything new can be challenging. “As with the introduction of every technology, it is not unusual for glitches to occur at the initial stages. These challenges are not peculiar to Liberia. Indeed, similar cases have been reported in other countries which, despite the initial glitches, ended up having very successful registration drives”, she noted.
The first stage of the process has ended as training to kickstart phase two is in progress. The preliminary results from Phase One of the Biometric Voter Registration (BVR) show that a total of 1,435,209 (one million four hundred thirty-five thousand two hundred and nine) citizens registered for the October elections, according to the National Elections Commission (NEC).
The NEC Chairperson admitted to some of the challenges raised by opposition politicians and ordinary citizens of Liberia.
Part of the statement read, “Liberians 18 years and above turned out in great numbers, and were registered even with the initial glitches, technical problems and filed challenges which the Commission’s Technical and Administrative Teams resolved on site.”
Former NEC Chairperson James Fromayan said the registration is progressing very slowly because of limited BVR equipment (one to a Registration Center).
“Conducting Voter Registration in phases suggests that the NEC does not have sufficient VR equipment to conduct simultaneous VR nationwide, which should be the case,” said Fomayan",18/04/2023,https://tsmliberia.com/tales-of-liberias-2023-biometric-registration-process/,1
"Young Brickmaker Is Sharon Mbabazi, Not Agatha",The Stage Media-Liberia,"Claim: Agatha got a degree in mass communication from brickmakingSource: Shine LiberiaVerdict: Partly True and FalseFull Text: From a Bricks ?? maker to a University graduate ????? – This story never gets old. I Sold bricks and used the money to support myself in University and the up-keeping of my children.Congratulations Agatha. Degree in Mass Communication.#ShineLiberiaThe post attracted 2.9K individuals, 453 comments, and 45 shares.Verification: TSM checked the lady’s name and her degree. We established that the name of the lady in the picture is Sharon Mbabazi of Uganda and not Agatha, as the blog post.As to the claim of her being a Mass Communication student, the blog is correct.Sharon earned a Mass-communication degree from Muteesa I Royal University in Mengo in 2018; The Observer published Mbabazi’s fantastic lifestyle, which defies gender and cultural biases in Uganda.This was after Sharon Mbabazi made a simple Facebookpost showcasing her brickmaking skill, becoming an overnight sensation.Brickmaking is a family activity involving Mbabazi’s brothers and her dad.The image went viral, generated public interest, and won the 23-year-old a lot of admiration for her sheer resolve and determination.Nicholas Bamulanzeki tracked her down in Masooli, Nangabo Sub-County, Wakiso District.Many societies regard brickmaking as an old-fashioned menial activity for energetic, uneducated men who have lost hope in getting tough jobs. It is also dirty and physically demanding, as one’s primary raw material is mud; seeing a young woman engage in such was shocking.Her mother’s death in 2005 opened Mbabazi’s life up to the harsh realities of poverty. The third-born in a family of five, she recalls being in P2 at the time, and her father warned them to brace for a tough life. She has had a troubled school life; she was always sent home for lack of fees or educational materials. Her elder siblings dropped out of school, but Mbabazi completed A-level in 2014.Conclusion: The post by Shine Liberia about a brickmaker is partly true as to her degree in Mass Communications and doing brickmaking for survival, but the blog is incorrect as to the lady’s name.

The Twist in Weah’s “Accountability” Ahead of 2023 Polls,Bettie Johnson-Mbayo,"Although Liberia’s President George Manneh Weah promised world leaders at the “2023 US Summit for Democracy” that the upcoming October 10, 2023, elections would be peaceful, enhancing the nation’s reputation as a democracy and showcasing Liberia as a bastion in Africa, this appears to be far from reality as he continuously disregards the Code of Conduct (CoC).The CoC, approved by former President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf in 2014, safeguards the electoral process and holds public officials accountable for using government assets and resources during elections.Part V of the CoC, which sets restrictions for government officials appointed by the President who desire to contest in any electoral process, has been repeatedly disrespected by the Liberian leaders and his officials, evidenced by the increasing number of resignations this April to contest the October 10 elections.Section 5.1 of the 2014 CoC says, “All officials appointed by the President of the Republic of Liberia shall not: a) engage in political activities, canvass, or contest for elected offices; b) use government facilities, equipment, or resources in support of partisan or political activities; c) serve on a campaign team of any political party or the campaign of any independent candidate.”5.2 Wherein any person in the category stated in section 5.1 herein above desires to canvass or contest for an elective public position, the following shall apply;a) Any Minister, Deputy Minister, Director-General, Managing Director, and Superintendent appointed by the President under article 56 (a) of the Constitution and a Managing Director appointed by a Board of Directors who desires to contest for public elective office shall resign said post at least two (2) years before the date of such elections;b) Any other official appointed by the President who holds a tenured position and desires to contest for elective office shall resign said post three (3) years before the date of such public elections; c) However, in the case of impeachment, death, resignation, or disability of an elected official, any official listed above, desirous of canvassing or contesting to fill such a position must resign said position within thirty days following the declaration by the National Elections Commission of the vacancy.Since the enactment of the CoC in 2014, there have been issues with adherence among appointed government officials, leaving interpretation to the Supreme Court for a way forward.ThrowbackWhen Abu Kamara, now representative of Montserrado County District 15, applied to contest the 2017 elections, the National Elections Commission (NEC) rejected his application because he served as Deputy Minister at the Ministry of Transport.He appealed the NEC’s ruling to the Supreme Court; Cllr. Arthur Johnson, the lawyer representing Kamara, received harsh criticism from the Bench for ignoring a previous decision of the high court on the CoC involving Selena Mappy Polson.The former Bong County Superintendent Polson argued that the CoC conflicted with some articles of the 1986 Constitution. Due to her role as superintendent, Polson also received a rejection letter for the 2017 election.Dr. Michael Slewion, then Director General of the Commission on Higher Education, was nominated to contest the Nimba County District #9 Representative seat. Still, his nomination was revoked after a concerned citizen of Nimba, Dahn Sherman, accused him (Slewion) of violating the CoC.Like Kamara and Polson, Slewion was also found liable by the NEC, and all appeals to challenge the commissioners’ decision were denied, and they were prevented from contesting.Despite these instances, Weah, who during his days in opposition called on government officials to uphold the CoC, now sits in the king’s seat and has refused to do what he advocated for.Due to the president’s refusal to uphold the CoC, its provision that speaks to public government officials’ access deceleration has been amended from publication deceleration to private. According to the amended CoC, official access can only be made public based on a request by the Supreme Court, which has created a bottleneck for citizens to hold their leaders accountable.The amended CoC was completed and submitted to Weah in 2022, which, according to Isaac Kelgbeh, Presidential Press Secretary, has been signed by the president but is yet to be printed on the handbill.The amendment also seeks to impose upon certain appointed officials of the Government of Liberia (GOL), certain officials of public corporations owned by the Government of Liberia (GOL), and certain officials of entities established by the National Legislature the obligation to resign their employment with the GOL, its corporations, and entities at least one year before the date of any election for which any such official intends to contest.If passed into law, the amendment will reduce the resignation period from two years for officials appointed at the will and pleasure of the President and three years for officials with tenure to one year.Almost seven months after submitting the amended CoC to Weah’s office, Executive Order #117 was issued, requiring all elected officials to resign by April 7, 2023, if they desired to contest the upcoming elections.The executive order now allows appointed officials to resign only six months before the October 10 general elections, which violates the existing CoC and the amended version, which has yet to be printed in a handbill.However, the Supreme Court ruled that the executive order was null and void because it never existed. It claims that the phrase “who desires to contest for any elected office” contradicts the executive order.Despite the high court mandate, social media has been flooded with resignations, even though the president has yet to act on them.Appointed Official AspirantsNameContesting forDistrict County PositionJosephine DaviesRepresentative10MontserradoInspector General, CommerceAnthony QuiwonkpaRepresentative3NimbaDeputy Minister without PortfolioJohnson QuaquaRepresentative5LofaLabor Commissioner, BassaBarbara KeahRepresentative1SinoeDevelopment SuperintendentDuanna KamaraSenatorBomiManaging Director, Liberia Water, and SewerAlex NoahRepresentative3SinoeSinoe Port ManagerZinnah NormanRepresentative1BopoluCity MayorJohn FlomoRepresentative4MonteserradoDirector General Liberia Agriculture Commodity Regulatory Authority(LACRA)Betty DohRepresentative3Grand GedehAssistant Superintendent for DevelopmentJ.

TSM-Liberia closely examines the most recent 2020 senatorial election held in the country.In the 2020 senatorial elections, J. Emmanuel Nuquay, then head of Liberia Civil Aviation, contested in Margibi. Gbezongar Findley, who served as Minister of Foreign Affairs, contested in Grand Bassa.Nuquay’s resignation letter was accepted three months before the elections, while Gbezongar resigned in July; both officials participated in the process that year.The same year, Mulbah Morlu, Chairman of the ruling Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC), named scores of newly appointed government officials to the party’s campaign committee for the ensuing December 8 senatorial elections across the country.Again in 2022, Morlu named a special committee on strategic planning and political engagement, including government officials violating Chapter 5.10 of the CoC.“Every Employee of Government shall ensure that his or her participation in political activities does not bring him or her into conflict with official duties,” the CoC reads.Eddie Jarwolo, Executive Director of Naymote, said the pronouncement by Weah is a cover-up because it will not be enforced.“The president knows he is in error; he sees pre-campaigning and is silent. His recent statement about the resignation will not be enforced; some may abide, but the law is being violated. “It is a waste of time and tends to undermine the integrity of the Elections Commission,” Jarwolo said.Loretta Pope-Kai, the head of the National Civil Society, stated, “The Code of Conduct is a perfect enabler for a level playing field that facilitates the fair and equal participation of all.”“This further bars people privileged to hold public offices from unduly influencing or inducing electorates at the expense of their positions.” Therefore, it is necessary for anyone who intends to run for public office to resign from the CoC.It is the last year of the President’s first constitutional tenure, and the CoC has not been implemented to the extent that even the ombudsman that is to be appointed by the president to monitor the law is yet to be named, less than six months before the October 10 elections.Pope-Kai, like other Liberians, wants the ombudsman, vested with the responsibility to enforce the CoC and scrupulously monitor public officials vying for elective posts, to be appointed.Weah was elected to power under the “Change for Hope” campaign that promised to undo all the negative aspects of the previous administration, which gave birth to the “Pro-Poor Agenda for Change and Prosperity.” But Weah’s constant abuse of the CoC has given his administration a bad reputation and exposed their disrespect for the rules of law, which cannot be justified.

Misleading; Costa didn’t Reiterate Quest To Become VP to Boakai,Mark Mengonfia,"Henry CostaImage Credit: FPAClaim: Henry P. Costa Reiterates Quest to Be Vice Standard Bearer to Unity Party’s Joseph BoakaiSource: FrontPage AfricaVerdict: MisleadingFull Text: March 20, 2023, to May 11, 2023, has been apportioned by the Liberia election governing body, National Elections Commission(NEC), for citizens of the country to register to vote.During this period, Liberians have been encouraged to participate in forming part of the October 10, 2023 election.When the process started in Montserrado and other counties on March 20, 2023, Liberians were seen going to the voter registration centers to enlist their names. This process qualifies one to exercise their franchise.A Franchise is a right to vote in elections and be elected by other eligible adult community members.One of those who have gone to ensure that their names are enlisted is a vocal Talk-Show host turned politician, Henry P. Costa, who is reportedly among those that have been considered to be picked as running mate to former Vice President, now Political leader of the opposition Unity Party (UP), Joseph N. Boakai.Many people, including bloggers, have posted referring Costa as the running mate to the former Vice President.The Liberia Influence, JK TV, and Shine Liberia have also posted, while Costa has opted for this slot.Verification: Costa has even publicly attacked other politicians who have doubted his ability to become a vice running mate but acknowledged that he (Costa) could not put himself forward as a VP candidate.After his registration, Costa was interviewed about his decision to either contest the senatorial seat of Montserrado County for which he had earlier expressed interest or await to be picked for vice Presidency.In response, he laughed and said, “You see in life, there are somethings that are within our control. I am running for Senator, that is what I am running for but I don’t get to decide whether I run as vice president. To be Vice President, you can not have an ambition to be vice president right? You have to be picked or selected by the person who is running for president. That person has to have confidence in you, that person has to be able to know and appreciate that you can help them win.”Since the interview, news outlets in Liberia, including one of Liberia’s outstanding newspapers, FrontPage Africa, published an article that the talk-show host in that interview reiterated his quest to be vice running mate.FPA carried a headline that said, “We Will Be On The Ballot” – Henry Costa Reiterates Quest To Be Vice Standard Bearer to Unity Party’s Joseph BoakaiConclusion: It is fair to state that the Frontpage Africa article is misleading. Henry had opted but did not reiterate his quest in the recent interview when he went to register.Related ",10/04/2023,https://tsmliberia.com/misleading-costa-didnt-reiterate-quest-to-become-vp-to-boakai/,0
Did Rep. Gray sit the Law School test five times and...,The Stage Media-Liberia,"Claims: Acarous wants to burn down UL because he’s mad at the UL administration for making the entrance exam hard. The man scored a hat trick + 2 in failing. Verdict: Unconfirmed  
Full text: Montserrado County District no. 8 lawmaker Acarous Moses Gray visited the Capitol Bypass Campus of the University of Liberia to have lunch. On his official Facebook page, the lawmaker said, “Come and enjoy lunch with me by 12:30 pm tomorrow at the University of Liberia Campus on Capitol Hill. We will also have a meet and greet with our students and constituents during our peaceful gathering. We have no intention to cause disruption or engage those who disagree with us.  Note: I, General Acarous Moses Tallahkai Tombekai Gray, will be there yah.” The March 13, 2023 gathering, which should have been peaceful, turned out the opposite.
There was stones-throwing and total disorder when members of the Student Unification Party( SUP) attempted to prevent him from having the “lunch. Gray insisted on providing a point and went on the campus with men with built bodies. The Monday scene saw bloodshed among students grouping through the presence of two elected officials representing two districts in Montserrado County (Representatives Acarous Moses Gray of District Eight and Yekeh Kolubah of District 10). Gray wanted to prove that he could not be booed like Vice President Jewel Howard-Taylor, former Solicitor General Cllr Seriana Cephus, and Finance Minister Samuel Tweah’s aid Aloyious Howard who all escaped the scene when SUP members ran them from the UL campus. 
Since the lawmaker’s forceful return to the University of Liberia campus,  he has received criticism from some members of the Liberian legislature, ordinary citizens, and political parties.
Liberty Party Public Relations officer Daniel Sando posted on social media about what happened on March 13 on the campus of the University of Liberia.
Sando posted on his official Facebook page.
Representative Gray wants to burn down the University because he is mad at the UL administration for making the entrance exam hard. Sando insinuated in his post that Representative Gray failed hat trick + 2 in failing (five times).
Verification: The Stage Media reached out to Gray and Sando to establish if the lawmaker sat the UL entrance five times and had failed all.
Representative Gray responded via SMS: “Sorry, but I don’t respond to a kid with an empty skull.”
In his response to our inquiry, Sando said, “This is no gossip that Gray failed the law school entrance five times.” Norris Tweah, Vice President, University Relations, told TSM that the University could not give out people’s personal information. He said even if The Stage Media sends in a Freedom Of Information(FOI) Request, they will not respond to said request.
Conclusion:  The Stage Media Could not independently confirm the claim made by the Liberty Party Public Relations officer, Daniel Sando, because Representative Gray and the University of Liberia declined to provide the needed information.

At this point, we can safely say that the claim is unconfirmed.  ",06/04/2023,https://tsmliberia.com/did-rep-gray-sit-the-law-school-test-five-times-and-fail-all/,0
Did Liberia Sign Gay Right Communique?,Mark Mengonfia,"Claim: Weah’s Government Endorses Gay Rights at Democracy SummitSource: The Independent Probe NewspaperVerdict: The claim Liberia signed to protect one’s Sexual Orientation right (Gay right) is UNVERIFIED.Full text: Liberia has been against same-sex marriage since it became a country.The Penal Law of Liberia, dated as far back as 1976, prohibited same-sex. The law criminalizes acts of ‘sodomy,’ broadly defined. This provision carries a maximum penalty of one-year imprisonment. Both men and women are criminalized under this law.Also, in November of 2018, a bill was introduced to amend the Penal Code to criminalize ‘same-sex practices.’ It was not discussed before the legislature went on recess in December.In 2012, A bill that would further criminalize ‘homosexual behavior’ was passed by the Liberian Senate, although former Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf vetoed the instrument.One of the famous slogans Liberians know is “Liberia was founded on a Christian principle,” a belief they have to the point that some Liberians see the nation drafting from its “ Christian” national principles. Efforts were made by a Church group under the banner of Liberia Restoration to Christian Heritage Committee (LRCHC) on Tuesday, March 19, 2013, petitioned the Liberian Legislature to Christianize Liberia from its current secular state.The group solicited over 700,000 signatures from across the country to amend specific provisions of the 1986 Constitution of Liberia to give the Christian religion an exclusive religious right.In the face of all these requests from the citizens of Liberia through their lawmakers, international partners who protect the rights of all humans have, on the other hand, been in the advocacy to ensure the sexual orientation rights of those who believe in the act of same-sex are respected.Recently, a delegation from Liberia headed by Minister of Foreign Affairs Dee-Maxwell Saah Kemayah attended a Democracy Summit in Lusaka, Zambia.They had discussions on many things, including democracy.At the end of their discussion, a communique was signed by the 76 countries that attended the Summit in Lusaka.The communique, with many counts, highlighted rights to freedom of democracy, combating authoritarian trends, civil and political rights, and the progressive realization of economic, social, and cultural rights.Count eight of the document was evident when it spoke to protecting the sexual orientation of all persons.Count eight states, “To promote respect for human rights and equality for all individuals and combat all forms of discrimination and exclusion on any grounds, consistent with international human rights law, including multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, including based on gender, race, ethnicity, color, religion or belief, national or social origin, property, birth, indigeneity, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, pregnancy, political opinion, class, genetic information, or age, and promote inclusion and the full and equal participation of all individuals in marginalized or vulnerable situations, including internally displaced persons.”A newspaper, The Independent Probe Liberia, published this information on its website. At the same time, it was also found here and here, “ Breaking News: Weah’s CDC Government Signed Gay Right.The “sycophantic” and “hypocritical” supporters and propagandists of Weah’s CDC government should please go tell the Liberian peepo dah [people that]  Weah government approved for men them to be having sex wif deh boy chayren and women dem to be having sex wif deh geh chayren[ sex with the boys children and women them to be having sex with girls children].Instead of focusing on the issues of development and the laws regarding pedophilia, Rape, sexual abuse, gender violence, etc., people want to use Obed Obed lies to label a man who has been very clear that he is not gay, has been married for 41 years, and has children & grandchildren”.To verify the claim, TSM sent two WhatsApp messages [April 3 and 4, 2023] to Liberia’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dee-Maxwell Saah Kemayah, requesting a clear understanding of whether the Liberia delegation signed any document that commits Liberia to gay rights.Although the Ministry saw the two messages but has not replied.If we do get comments from them, this article will be updated.Also, a media executive, Malcolm W. Joseph, who attended the conference, was contacted on April 3, 2023, requesting similar clarity. He, too, is yet to reply to the inquiry made by TSM.Meanwhile, Liberia’s Ministry of Information, Culture Affairs, and Tourism, Legdgerhood Julius Rennie, on April 4, 2023, appeared on State Radio, LBS, and said the information was fake and misleading, despite Liberia ever signing the said document.The Liberian Minister said the discussion held at the Summit was about democracy, and nothing about Gay rights was discussed as was claimed by the newspaper.All research and requests to get a document copy did not materialize.Conclusion: With the information gathered thus far from the Independent Probe Newspaper’s publication and the refusal of Minister Kermaya and others to speak to the claim coupled with a statement from the Minister of Information, we can only say the claim is unverified.Related ",06/04/2023,https://tsmliberia.com/did-liberia-sign-gay-right-communique/,0
Misleading to suggest Weah increased Armed Forces of Liberia budget by...,The Stage Media-Liberia,"Claim: The Ministry of Information, Cultural Affairs and Tourism (MICAT) claimed that “President George Weah increased the army’s budget by US$4 million in FY 2022.”Verdict: Misleading! The FY 2022 national budget shows that the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL)’s budget was increased by US$2,881,211m.Full TextTheArmed Forces of Liberiahas historically been to defend and guard the Country’s borders, safeguard national security, and protect the population from external aggression.It became the Armed Forces of Liberia in 1970 from the Liberian National Guard.On January 13, 2023, the Ministry of Information, Cultural Affairs and Tourism (MICAT)tookto its official Facebook page to highlight the numerous achievements President George Weah made during five years. It was cited that “President George Weah increased the army budget by US$4 million in FY 2022.”Ministry of Information Cultural (MICAT)’spostabout the AFL first under section 11, themed: “PUBLIC SAFETY & NATIONAL SECURITY,” attracted 172 reactions, 166 comments and 117 as of March 1, 2023, with commenters having mixed views about the post.But did it mean that MICAT’s post about the army’s budgetary increment was also a great booster to the AFL operations?DUBAWA verified facts surrounding the ministry’s claim and further ascertained what the increment meant for the military.VerificationThe fiscal year (FY) 2022 of theArmed Forces of Liberia (ALF)was examined by DUBAWA, and it revealed that the AFL, which is a department under the direction and supervision of the Ministry of National Defense, was budgetarily allocated US$16,361,844m of the US$18,695,921m the Defense Ministry received that year.To verify the actual figure of the army’s budget was increased in FY 2022, DUBAWA checked the FY 2020-2021, and it shows that the AFL got US$13,480,633m of the US$14,412,445 the Ministry of National Defense received.Also, in 2021, a “Special National Budget, Fiscal Year 2021” was passed, and on that budget, the AFL received US$2,464,633m of the US$7,853,070m that was given to the Defense Ministry.In 2022, the ALF was allocated US$16,361,844m of the US$18,695,921m the Defense Ministry received.Screenshot of the AFL budget.This researcher then visited the legislative budget office (LBO), a technicalarmof the legislature that provides an objective, impartial, and professional analysis of the national budget, to establish if the 2021 Special Budget is also a part of the 2020-2021 FY, and they clarified that “the Special National Budget, Fiscal Year 2021, which ran from July 2021 to December 2021, was a budget year all by itself and cannot be combined with any other budget year.”The AFL’s FY 2020-2021 budget was then subtracted from the FY 2022 budget, and the math resulted in a US$2,881,211m increment, contrary to MICAT’s claim that the army’s budget was increased by $4 million in FY 2022.This researcher reached out to the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces Liberia (AFL), Major General Prince Johnson, to have him speak to MICAT’s claim and the content of the budget. Still, Gen Johnson stated, “When we say our budget was increased by $4 million in FY 2022, we meant the Ministry of National Defense, which includes: Central Administration, the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) and the Liberia Coast Guard; not specifically the AFL.”Subtracting the Ministry of National Defense FY 2020-2021 from their FY 2022 showed that FY 2022 increased by US$4,283,476m.But what did the increase mean for the ALF?The Chief of Staff explained that “the increment of the army’s FY 2022 budget boosted the operations of the ALF through recruitment of more AFL personnel, promotions of the institution, and renovations of our barracks.”ConclusionThe FY 2022 budget reveals that the Ministry of National Defense budget was increased by US$ 4 million and not the AFL. Therefore, MICAT’s claim that “President George Weah increased the army’s budget by US$4 million in FY 2022” is misleading.

Hoax! “Ecobank is not Running any Subsidy Reward Scheme.”,The Stage Media-Liberia,"Claim: “Ecobank National Government is rewarding a $8000 subsidy.”Verdict: Hoax! (False!) Ecobank-Liberia says it is not running any subsidy reward scheme.Full Text: Recently, a message has been circulating on WhatsApp that Ecobank is granting a subsidy.The viral WhatsApp message claims that the Ecobank National Government provides US$8000 subsidy scheme.The Stage Media checks the site to verify its truthfulness or if it is just another fraudulent site that has been created to dupe people’smoney and their personal information.Verification: When clicked, the link of the message takes users to a questionnaire page where it is indicated that “through the questionnaire, you will have a chance to get $8000.”Screenshot of the viral WhatsApp messageAlso, several commenters are seen giving testimonies of how they have been rewarded for partaking in the scheme.Screenshot of the siteThe Stage Media answered the questions about the age range, rating of the bank, and gender, amongst others, that popped up to verify the truthful nature of what the site was purporting to offer.Like several other scam sites, users are instructed to share the program with five WhatsApp groups or 20 WhatsApp friends to win US$8000 congratulatory prize that appears after answering the questions.After sharing, a complete registration form appeared where users are informed that it’s the final step to getting the prize within 5-7 days, but a completely different site which directs us to Premier Bet (a betting site) popped up where users are asked for their personal information, including passcode and phone number.This fact-checker scanned the site on scamdoc, a web tool that evaluates digital identities, and analysis shows that the site has a terrible trust index and the owner of the site domain name is hidden.Though analysis from Scamdoc doesn’t influence the rating of a specific domain, TSM, however placed multiple calls to Ecobank-Liberia, after which they took to their official Facebook page to announce that the bank is not running any subsidy reward scheme and further cautioned people to avoid clicking any link requiring personal or bank details.Screenshot of Ecobank announcementConclusion: The message circulating on WhatsApp thatEcobank is providing US$8000 reward scheme is a hoax.

Two Images From Recent SUP-Lawmakers Protest that you should not Believe,The Stage Media-Liberia,"On the University of Liberia campus on March 13, there were clashes between student organizations and lawmakers. The conflict erupted when Montserrado County District #8 Representative Acarous Gray stormed the main campus of the University of Liberia (UL) to settle scores with the leadership and members of the campus-based Student Unification Party (SUP).The invasion, resisted by hardliners known as militants, resulted in a heated hour-long stone-throwing skirmish in which several people were injured.The lawmaker, who had gone under the pretense of eating lunch on the campus of the country’s top public university, was reportedly enraged by SUP militants harassing ruling-party allies thought to be corrupt government employees.Gray Lunch FlyerYekeh Kolubah, an opposition politician and ardent detractor of President George Weah, rushed to the aid of the students and fought back against Rep. Gray and his men as they drove the students from the school.Yekeh Kolubah, a representative for Montserrado County District #10, addressed the student body (SUP) as Gray spoke to his fans and urged them to forgive Gray for the act of violence.Before both lawmakers’ visits, the University of Liberia canceled all academic and administrative activities on the Capitol Hill campus, citing safety concerns of students, faculty, staff, and the public, and expressed deep regret for said cancellation.The release says, “The University of Liberia (UL) hereby cancels all Normal Academic and Administrative Activities on its Capitol Hill Campus beginning at 12 noon today, Monday, March 13, 2023.The student center where Gray’s scheduled lunch was to take place was locked before his arrival on campus.Image Credit: Facebook But Gray posted this on his Facebook page.During these scenes, several blogs, including news outlets, reported that one student, Boakai Prout, had died in the clash.According to Shine Liberia, Prout’s lifeless body was allegedly discovered at the University of Liberia capitol hill campus.The post attracted 225 reactions, 163 comments, and 24 shares.The claim is also seen on Point View’s social media profile, another profile, and the University of Liberia Gees page.Excluding Prout’s claim, a social media account Macclean Renner Posted “Hon.

Hon.Gray is carrying GUN!!SUP is doing everything to hold the campus as I write??????????The post showing a lady bruised on her face by Rennner attracted 130 comments, 28 shares, and 28 reactions.Verification: The Stage Media did a Google reverse search on the photos making rounds.It was established that the image depicting Prout was taken on September 7, 2016, in Salala, lower Bong County.The images of a gruesome body were discovered right in the middle of the main street of Salala, as seen in the photograph.The second image of a woman with wounds on her face is not from the SUP-lawmakers clash.It is from the just-ended February Nigerian Elections.“The incident reportedly occurred in a polling station where the woman was attacked by a group of thugs.Eyewitnesses say that the thugs used a bottle to inflict the injuries on the woman before fleeing the scene.”The article was published by Foundation for Investigative Journalism (FIJ).She is also seen voting in this video on Twitter.Conclusion: Following the research done by TSM, we can say that the images posted as Prout and a wounded woman didn’t occur during the March 13, 2023 clash at the University of Liberia.We also cannot verify if there’s a student named Boakai Prout, as the University of Liberia has yet to respond to our inquiry.At the same time, Shine Liberia has deleted its post, while the University of Liberia Gees page apologized for publishing similar.

Police Boss’s Claim On Officers- to-Citizens Ratio; No Data,Bettie Johnson-Mbayo,"Claim: The Police-to- population ratio in Liberia is 1:1,700. Verdict: False. There is no data to support the claim.
Full Text: Police Inspector General Patrick Sudue appeared before the Liberia Senate on February 28 to answer several security inquiries. During the appearance, he disclosed that the police–to–population ratio is 1:1,700. The Liberian National Police (LNP) is the frontline force of internal security in the fight against crimes, protecting life and property, and maintaining the rule of law, as directed by its statute. U.N. peacekeepers went into Liberia in 2003 to stabilize the country after years of civil war led to a collapse of the state.
After ten years of peacekeeping efforts, the United Nations is gradually drawing down its troops in Liberia from about 8,000 to 3,750 by July 2015, leaving the sole security to Liberia.
Verification: Liberia’s first recruitment campaign was launched on May 5, 2004, with UNMIL.
The new recruitment drive targeted 1,374 police officers and occurred throughout the country. The projected strength was 3,500. In 2009, the United Nations recorded that 3,800 officers were trained in modern policing methods and techniques. Also, a 2013 report named “No Money, No Justice” said the Liberia National Police (LNP) stands at 4,417 police officers.
UNMIL estimated that Liberia would need 8,000 officers, or nearly double the current LNP force, to adequately serve the Liberian public upon the U.N.’s departure in 2013. A 2015 Security Council report states that as of August 1, there were 4,886 national police officers, of whom 17.6 percent were women. The Stage Media contacted the Liberia National Police, and the number is put at 3558 officers are males while 886 are females, which amounts to 4,444 officers in Liberia. Security expert Togba Emmanuel in a post, Since the drawdown of UNMIL, Liberia is still recording a 1:1,268 police-to-citizen ratio against the U.N. police-to-citizens ratio standard 1: 220 judging from the new Census. He says as per the 2022 Census outcomes, Liberia needs about 23k Police officers to meet the required Law enforcement standard of the United Nations. Liberia’s population is now estimated at 5.2 million, according to the provisional census results released by The Liberia Institute for Statistics and Geo-Information Services (LIGIS). This comes roughly fifteen years after the country conducted the first post-war National Population and Housing Census in 2008 during the first term of former President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf. Provisional results released in March 2008 estimated Liberia’s population at 3,489,072.
Conclusion: While the Liberia National Police claims 4444 officers in its force, it is reasonable to argue that the officer-to-citizen ratio claimed by the LNP’s Inspector General lacks statistics.",13/03/2023,https://tsmliberia.com/police-bosss-claim-on-officers-to-citizens-ratio-no-data/,0
50% Drop in Teen Pregnancy? We Checked the Claim by Swedish Ambassador,Bettie Johnson-Mbayo,"Screenshot of Swedish Ambassador PostThe Deputy Ambassador of Sweden to Liberia and Sierra Leone Johan Romare, on Friday, in a Twitter post, said Teenage pregnancies have reduced by 50% since 2016 in Southeast.According to him, family planning is key for sexual reproductive health rights and the empowerment of girls and boys.“Well done Liberia! Teenage pregnancies reduced by 50% since 2016 in Southeast. Family planning key for SRHR & empowerment of girls & boys – key for sustainable development! Good cooperation Ministry Health & Education, County Health Teams, UNFPA & partners for lasting results,” Romare’s.Romare is the deputy head of mission, and head of development cooperation at the Embassy of Sweden in Liberia. The post attracted 1k views.We contacted the Swedish deputy ambassador to tell us the source of the claim, but there has been no response. If there’s we will update this article.Teenage pregnancies in Liberia continue to be a severe health and economic problem for Liberia. This problem has drastically lowered girls’ overall economic productivity and shortened their life expectancy in the country.On July 20, 2016, the Swedish Embassy and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) signed a $5.3 million collaboration agreement to implement the ‘Empowered and Fulfilled’, a four-year initiative.Sweden contributed forty million Swedish Krona (SEK 40 million), approximately US$4,670,000 over the four years of the project implementation, while UNFPA contributed US$675,600.The project aimed to increase young people’s awareness and skills regarding their sexual and reproductive health and rights in Liberia’s southern counties, including Sinoe, Grand Gedeh, Grand Kru, Maryland, and River Gee.It established an enabling atmosphere for the respect and fulfilment of the sexual and reproductive health and rights of young people, consequently helping to reduce the high prevalence of teenage pregnancies in Liberia.Also, on August 18  2020, the Embassy of Sweden and the United Nations Population Fund signed an agreement for Sweden’s contribution of forty-three million Swedish Krona (SEK 43,000), approximately US$4.9 million to support UNFPA Country Program document for Liberia over the next four and half years.The current UNFPA Country Program for Liberia (2020-2024) is fully aligned with the Government of Liberia’s Pro-Poor Agenda for Prosperity and Development (PAPD) 2018-2023.It aims to help achieve the goal of universal access to sexual and reproductive health rights (SRHRs) by ensuring that women, adolescents, and youth, especially those who are marginalized and far behind, have improved access to high-quality, gender-responsive, comprehensive, and integrated services.The Liberia Family Planning Costed Implementation Plan shows that the modern contraceptive prevalence rate (mPCR) among all women currently stands at 30.7%. The mCPR has changed significantly over the past decade, nearly tripling from 11.7%).Further, women in urban areas have a slightly higher mCPR (31.6 percent) than their rural counterparts (29.1 percent). However, the urban-rural gap is increasingly narrowing as more rural women use modern contraceptives. Within three years (2013 to 2016), the rural mCPR grew by 12.8 percentage points.The plan shows more women seeking contraceptives in southeastern counties than in Greater Monrovia.Contraceptive use per RegionThe Liberia Demographic Health Survey (LDHS) 2019–20 states that Liberia’s total fertility rate (TFR) is 4.2 children per woman.The TFR is lower in urban areas (3.4 children per woman) than in rural areas (5.5 children per woman). Age-specific fertility rates peak at age 20–24 (193 births per 1,000 women) and are lowest among young women younger than 15 (4 births per 1,000 women) and women aged 45–49 (16 births per 1,000 women).The LDHS places teenage pregnancy and motherhood in southeastern “A” counties that include: Grand Gedeh, Grand Kru, RiverGee, Maryland, and Rivercess at 32% in 2007, 38% in 2009, and now 30% in 2019-20.“Across the counties, the percentage of teenagers who have begun childbearing ranges from 19% in Maryland to 55% in RiverCess.”The UNFPA 2020 report showed a 48 percent increase in teenage pregnancy in 2013, but in 2020 there is a decline of 27%.Screenshot of UNFPA, 2020Additionally, an FPA article titled “Teenage Pregnancy ‘Drastically’ Decreasing in Southeastern Liberia amid UNFPA, Swedish Government’s Intervention” shows that in 2013, teenage pregnancy stood at a whopping 57.9 percent in these three counties.“However, with the intervention of a multifaceted reproductive health program, the ‘Sexual Reproductive Health and Rights Services to Young People’ funded by the Swedish Government through UNFPA, the number has dramatically reduced to 27.2 percent in 2020.”Yei Kilikpo, Executive Director of Public Health Intiatives Liberia (PHIL) says  data report needs to corroborated with the reality adding that though the data has changed but the decrease is not 50 percent.“If they both (data and reality) concur with each other it would be a great learning for the country and the sub-region . As National teen pregnancy is still the same in the space of 5 yrs the data didn’t change significantly as 31% teen girls got pregnant before the age of 18 in 2015 and by 2021 not much change as it went from 31 to 30,” said Madam Kilikpo.Conclusion: ContraceptiveusehasgrownintheSouthEasternCounties,itistrue,butteenpregnancyhasnotfallenby50%.Related ",09/03/2023,https://tsmliberia.com/50-drop-in-teen-pregnancy-we-checked-the-claim-by-swedish-ambassador/,1
"True, Varlee Tarlee did not Attend his Baby’s Naming Ceremony",The Stage Media-Liberia,"Varlee in White shirtClaim: Varlee was absent from his child’s naming ceremonySource: Social Media blog named Law and DemocracyVerdict: Varlee Tarlee was not present at his child’s naming ceremony on February 26, 2023.Full Text: Varlee Tarlee, the Monrovia City Police officer who Cllr. Jerome Verdier claims was hired by Monrovia City Mayor Jefferson Koijee to attack former Chief Justice Gloria Musu Scott and kill her foster daughter He has been accused of skipping his baby’s dedication ceremony because he was hurt in the alleged incident.The incident happened on February 22, 2023, between 9 and 10 p.m. in the Sheriff Gas Station Community in the Virginia Township, District 17, Montserrado County.Tarlee didn’t fulfill Qur’an 33: 5, which states, “Call them by [the names of] their fathers; it is more just in the sight of Allah…”Social media users took to Facebook to accuse Tarlee of boycotting his baby’s naming ceremony because he was absconding from the public since Justice Scott said she escaped the horrific scene when she sprayed the attacker’s eyes.But Tarlee, in a press conference on February 27, denied knowing the former Chief Justice.“The lady you are talking about, I don’t know her.” I live in Brewerville. From my work area, I go home. I don’t know anything about the counselor.”Verification: After the incident, it is a fact that Tarlee made his first appearance after the alleged incident on February 27—four days after the accusation by Cllr. Verdier in a live podcast.Tarlee was invited by police, at which time he confirmed his absence during his child’s naming ceremony on Sunday, February 26, 2023, at his residence in Brewerville.When asked by reporters why he wasn’t present to bring his child out during the naming ceremony as his tradition required, he said that he was unable to attend due to eye trouble.But he clarified that he has had an eye problem since 1994, when he took part in an unspecified attack while fighting in Liberia’s civil war.Tarlee was a member of the Special Security Unit (SSU), and ATU. But admitted to his involvement in the civil war. However, he said he is a changed man now.When asked by a journalist about his whereabouts at the time of the incident, Tarlee said he was not home. Rather, he was at work. Tarlee added: “At the time of the incident, I was at City Hall. I spent most of my time at the Monrovia City Hall.”The Gulf Times said a baby may be named on the day of its birth, on the third day, or later, on the seventh day or past the seventh day, as this is what is clear after studying all the evidence from the Sunnah.It is the father or the mother who chooses the name for the baby.“Parents may also let others name their child, as our Prophet did with several of his Companions’ children.”Conclusion: Tarlee did not attend his child’s naming ceremony; nevertheless, we cannot confirm that his absence was due to the accusation that he murdered the former Chief Justice Foster’s daughter.Related ",03/03/2023,https://tsmliberia.com/true-varlee-tarlee-did-not-attend-his-babys-naming-ceremony/,1
Liberia’s Capital City is Most Populated? We checked MPC’s head claims...,Bettie Johnson-Mbayo,"Image Credit: Independent ProbeWhen businessman and political leader of the opposition Movement for Progressive Change (MPC), Simeon Freeman, appeared on OK FM on February 27, he made several claims.Freeman is rallying support for opposition collaboration as the country’s Presidential and Legislative Election is in October.According to him, a-one opposition can defeat President George Weah, who is seeking re-election for a second term.Freeman has contested two elections, mainly in 2011 and 2017, and results show that he didn’t make the top five.We look at the claims made by Freeman during his radio appearance.1.    Liberia has the highest capacity population density in Africaa.    37 percent of the population lives in the capital city.b.    Monrovia population is 1.6 Millionc.    All other African countries have 10-15 percent of their people in the capital city.According to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development 2022 report, there are two categories in which African cities are clustered: size or density.Some clusters are dense, having cities near one another, although they might not have many cities. Some sets include a similar number of cities but may not be as thick due to the cities’ slightly greater separation.There are a few vast, dense groups. They have a large number of nearby cities. A compact city cluster is where at least 2.5 million urban dwellers reside in towns with more than 30 000 inhabitants no more than 100 road kilometers apart.A sizeable urban cluster is defined as a region where at least 10 million urban residents live in cities with more than 30 000 inhabitants within 250 kilometers of each other. An expansive city cluster can include one or more compact clusters.The report named Egypt the largest cluster of cities along the Nile and within its delta. It is one of the few examples of a compact city cluster with a vast population. It is home to more than 80% of Egypt’s population, with 82 million urban dwellers.Egypt also contains six more cities with more than one million population.In addition to Cairo, the second-largest compact city cluster consists of cities in Nigeria and Benin, specifically Lagos, Ibadan, and Cotonou. According to the African Development Bank, it boasts 33 million urban dwellers, despite having no other cities with populations greater than one million.While the largest expansive city cluster covers West African cities from Kumasi (Ghana) in the west to Kano (Nigeria).The Business Insider Africa said Lagos, Nigeria, is the most populated city in Africa, followed by D.R. Congo and Egypt.In 2021, Mauritius was named as having the highest population density by Statista, while World Bank named Guinea Bissau in 2020 and DR Congo in 2021.Conclusion: Liberia does not have the highest capacity population density in Africa.1a. No, 37 percent of the population does not live in the capital city. Monrovia, the capital of Liberia, was founded in 1822 by formerly enslaved people from the United States of America and was named after US president James Monroe.It is located on a hilly peninsular between the Mesurado river and the Atlantic Ocean on the West Coast of Africa. The Mesurado River separates the mainland from Bushrod and Balli islands.In 1986, the population of Monrovia was estimated at around 572,000 inhabitants. This number peaked at the height of the civil war; between 1990 – 2004, the people of Monrovia were reported to have doubled to over 1,000,000, according to City Alliance.Monrovia is considered a primate city, although it is more accurately a census district comprising the city of Monrovia, the city of Paynesville, eight townships, and one borough in the UN Habitat 2020 report.With a population exceeding 1.3 million, representing nearly 29 percent of the national population, Monrovia is the hub of the country’s administrative, economic, and transport activities.The World Bank reported Monrovia’s population at 30 percent in 2021.1b. Exaggeration, the population in Monrovia is not 1.6 Million; the UN-Habitat 2020 report puts the number at 1.3 million, while the World Bank 2021 report says 1.5 million.The Liberia Institute of Statistics and Geo-Information Services (LISGIS) announced the provisional results of its 2022 National Population and Housing Census.Acting head of LISGIS, Lawrence George, said: “The de facto Population in Liberia on Census Night [November 10-11, 2022] was 5.2 million (5,248,621). The total population increased by 1,772,013 (50 percent) [when] compared to the 2008 census.George said the provisional results show Montserrado County accounts for 37 percent of the total population enumerated, but there has not been an official percentage for Monrovia.1c. All other countries have 10-15 percent of their population in the capital city. No, it’s incorrect.

"Viral Shell plc recruitment on WhatsApp, false",The Stage Media-Liberia,"Claim:A WhatsApp message containing a link to a website purporting to be the British multinational oil and gas company Shell claims that the company offers jobs for skilled and unskilled labourers.Verdict:False. The WhatsApp link claiming that Shell offers jobs for 2023 is fake and misleading. The Link, upon verification, is not for the official company.Full TextA WhatsApp message containing a link to a website purporting to be the British multinational oil and gas company Shell states that the company offers jobs for skilled and unskilled labourers.A screenshot of the WhatsApp message.Once you open the link in the WhatsApp message, it takes you toa website, and the front page shows an image of individuals wearing the reflected work suit and the company logo.The site also contains an application form with questions such as “Select Title, Your First Name, Last Name, Phone Number, Email address, and Country.”It is important to note that however applicants answer these questions, they will be directed to another step which automatically “congratulates” and qualifies the applicant to work with the company. When the steps are completed, applicants are again asked to share the link with “five people or 15 friends on WhatsApp.” After the green verification bar is filled, he or she will also be redirected automatically to the company’s appointment page.Applicants are also told that after these processes, they will receive a confirmation email within 24 hours after a successful application.VerificationScamAdviser.com, averification toolused to certify the originality of websites and links, was used to analyse the authenticity oflinks. Upon analysis, findings show that the alleged Shell website was suspicious and was rated with a “very bad trust” tag and flagged up as a link associated with scammers.A screenshot of a fact-check report conducted by the researcher on ScamAdviser.Further research established that the website of the British multinational companyShell Group of Companies doesnot carry anything like “TABNAIJA” in its URL. The Companydoes have jobsfor skilled and unskilled labourers on their website, but the requirements for these jobs are not to fill out an application form and are in contrast to what was specified on the false link. The real company is also aware of these scam alerts. It has issueda caution on its websiteabout people or sites claiming to be offering jobs at their company.“Please note that Shell Group of companies (nor any of the organisations that recruit on our behalf) never ask for any money or payments from applicants at any point in the recruitment process. All individuals who successfully gain an offer of employment from a Shell Group company, whether directly or indirectly, are always required to undergo a formal recruitment process. All communications should originate from a verifiable Shell e-mail address and not from an Internet e-mail address, e.g., Hotmail, yahoo etc.”Recruitment scamsAccording to the Shell Group company’s official site, the fraud scam section states:“The job offers come from organisations falsely pretending to recruit on behalf of Shell Group companies or by people claiming to work for or be affiliated to a Shell Group company. These propositions notify individuals that their qualifications were found suitable to work as an employee (local or expatriate) for a Shell Group company and solicit the transfer of significant sums of money to pay for work permits, insurance policies, etc.”Meanwhile, the company asks those wanting to seek jobs from them to consider that they do not request money from applicants at any point in the recruitment process.Internet users are cautioned against opening these viral links.ConclusionBased on research, our finding reveals the link in the WhatsApp message has a URL that contains words such as “tabnaija,” which cannot be found anywhere in the original link of Shell Group.It has the potential to compromise people’s private information, meaning some webpages, like that of the purported Shell Oil and Gas recruitment site, is a risk to personal devices and may interfere with the privacy of individuals who access them at any given point.

Explainer:  The state of Liberia’s 2022 National   ...,The Stage Media-Liberia,"Image Credit: LISGISCensusinvolves the complete enumeration of the population of a country. It shows the number of household members, tribal groups, and religions.Its results are used to impact programs, planning, and policies for the welfare of the development of a country.Article 39 of the 1986constitutionof Liberia states that “the Legislature shall cause a census of the Republic to be undertaken every ten (10) years.” Since its independence in 1847, according to the Liberia Institute of Statistics and Geo-Information Services (LIGIS), Liberia has conductedfour censuses, with 1,016 in 1962, 1,503 in 1974, 2,102 in 1984, and 3,477 in 2008, respectively.By law, the next census was expected to have been conducted in 2018. Still, according to the United Nations Missions in Liberia’ (UNMIL) February 21, 2018report, which was extracted from theDaily Observer, “the House of Representatives and the Senate decided to postpone the March 26, 2018, scheduled national census to an undetermined future date because the government cannot raise its share of 50 per cent of the USD20 million needed to carry out the national census.”Controversy over postponementThe new date for the organisation of the country’s census was not without controversy.An AllAfrica August 31, 2022,reportexplained that “the Liberian Senate, after a lengthy plenary discussion on June 16, 2022, moved the census to March 18 to 30, 2023, pending a concurrence by the House of Representatives, although the Liberia Institute for Statistics and Geo-Information Services (LISGIS) had proposed 16 to October 28 2022 for the conduct of the 2022 census.”Thereportalso showed that on July 25, 2022, International Partners, includingECOWAS and the United Nations, wrote a letter that was signed by UN Resident Coordinator Niels Scott and co-signed by Finance & Development Planning Minister Samuel D. Tweah, Jr., who chairs LISGIS board, advising President Weah about the financial implications and ramifications if the census is postponed to March 2023.The partners argued that the obligatory payments to census staff would be negatively impacted if the census is delayed further.They indicated the postponement would also affect the loan agreement between Liberia and Ghana regarding providing 21,000 tablets and power banks, respectively.The partners also warned about donor fatigue regarding the payment of nearly US$800,000 if the census isn’t held in October. A postponement to December means the government and its partners must raise US$2 million amid global economic challenges.In total, more than US$8.8 million would have been lost if the census wasn’t held in October,” thereportindicated.On August 10, 2022, President George Weah formallywroteto Members of the 54th Legislature to convene a Special or Extraordinary Session for 30 days to discuss, among many things, “the setting of a new census date.”A Daily Observerreportquoted President Weah as saying, “the postponement of the Census from October 2022 to November 2022 will create an added staff cost of US$139,000; December 2022, is staff cost of US$278,000; and in March 2023, a staff cost of US$695,000.Through south-south cooperation, the Government of Ghana loaned the Government of Liberia 21,000 electronic data collection tablets and accessories, which will be returned at the end of October 2022.If the census were not in October 2022, these devices would be returned, and the Government of Liberia will have to purchase its electronic tablets at US$5,355,000. Also, the financial commitment by donors may not be fulfilled if the census was not conducted in October 2022,” the President noted.On September 15, 2022, President George Weahsignedinto law a Joint Resolution of the National Legislature for the conduct of the National Housing and Population Census, following a joint resolution from the Senate and House of Representatives authorizing the Executive Branch of Government to conduct the National Census from October 24 to November 7, 2022.But according to an October 21, 2022, publication of the Daily Observer Newspaperreport, with just four days to kick off the fifth and first digital National Population and Housing Census (NPHC), on October 20 2022, the census was postponed by 15 days following a consensual decision reached during a leadership meeting with authorities of the Liberia Institute for Statistics and Geo-Information Services (LISGIS) and the head of Liberia’s Census Fund the UNFPA. As a result, President Weah, by proclamation, declared Friday, November 11, 2022, as “National Census Day,” and it was observed throughout the Republic as a National Holiday.The date is fixed; thus,new challenges set inNovember 22, 2022, Frontpage Africapublicationauthored that “the initial ten days stipulated for the conduct of the 2022 national population and housing census elapsed, but only 40,027 people, representing less than five per cent of the estimate, were counted.”The slow pace of the counting, according to LISGIS, was mainly due to “logistical challenges and difficulties in reaching hard-to-reach counties in the Southeast,” the report added.DUBAWA spoke with a few Liberians about what they make of the drama surrounding the 2022 national census and how they feel about the entire exercise:“I feel awful about how this whole census business is going. After they told us to stay home, my house of six human beings has not even been counted. I don’t trust whatever result LIGIS may come up with, and I’m not interested because the news outside there has not been so encouraging,” Benaweh Harris, a Towel Hill, Margibi County resident, said.A resident of Central Monrovia, Alice Weegar, also stated, “they never count my children and me. They only came to my house and marked it. Since they left, they haven’t come back to count us. They’re not doing well at all.”Apart from the difficulties in getting people to count, there were also many discrepancies, complaints about corruption, frustrations, disenchantments and misunderstanding that characterised the 2022 census process.Enumerators and supervisors have protested across the country and expressed distrust in the conduct of the census. The former Acting Director General of LIGIS, Wilmot Smith and his Deputy, Alex Williams, weresackedby President George Weah on November 14, 2022, on administrative grounds.The Liberia Anti-Corruption Commission (LACC), however, on June 16, 2022, issued its “Final Report on LISGIS Corruption Investigation.”The LACC report, in its nine-count findings and analysis, showed that the Director General of LISGIS, Francis Wreh, his Deputy Director General for Administration, Lawrence George, former Deputy Director General for Information Coordination Wilmot-Smith, among other high-ranking officials, made several illegal monetary transactions intended for the National Housing and Population Census (NHPC), for which their prosecutions were recommendation by the LACC.Census results and matters arisingJustina Harris, the Communication Director ofLIGIS, disclosed to DUBAWA through a telephone interview on Thursday, January 19, 2023, that “by next week, the provisional results will be out.As for the final results, it will take months before they can be out because a lot of things still need to be done,” she stated.Meanwhile, in a WhatsApp call interview with DUBAWA on February 4, 2022, former Deputy Director General for Statistics and Data Processing of LISGIS,Alex Williams, said, “corruption took the total stage while I was at LISGIS. I wrote multiple communications about the situation, but there was no result, and so, on November 12, 2022, I tendered my letter of resignation to the board of directors of LIGIS. Unfortunately, on November 14, two days after I resigned, I saw on the Executive Mansion that I was dismissed.”Williams, who labelled the 2022 census as “a flaw, failure and an embarrassment to Liberia,” stated, “the census results could not have been announced the time it should have because there are no real results and people have to take time to manipulate the results by adding random numbers.”“I want to tell the folks at LIGIS to be honest to the Liberian people and tell them that they (LISGIS) haven’t done a good job. The Liberian people themselves shouldn’t accept any result coming from LISGIS. The new government should conduct a new census that would be more scientific, legitimate and realistic,” Williams indicated.He explained that “one of the fundamental reasons why the census is conducted is to impact programs, planning and policies for the welfare of the development of the country.”“The census results should be utilised for setting a threshold, after which the National Elections Commission (NEC) should use for electoral constituency demarcation before voter registration. That constitutional provision also will not be satisfied in the upcoming elections because of the timing and the inept nature of those at LIGIS. This could lead to the manipulation of census results for political reasons,” Williams averred.

"No, AMEU And AMEZU Presidents Haven’t Resign",The Stage Media-Liberia,"Image Credit: Analyst NewspaperClaims: President of AME University Alvin Attah and AME Zion University Benjamin Lartey have stepped downVerdict: false Both Dr. Attah and Dr. Lartey never stepped down.Full text: Martin Kollie, a social activist and lead campaigner of the Campaigners for Academic Crimes Court (CACC), on Friday, February 17, posted that the presidents of the African Methodist Episcopal University (AMEU) and African Methodist Episcopal Zion University (AMEZU) resigned.“Breaking News…AMEU President Alvin Attah and AMEZU President Benjamin Lartey have stepped down. Great decision. Others at UL, SMPU, Smythe, UMU etc. Must also step down. CACC will pursue them, no more free ride.”AMEU is a private higher education institution. The African Methodist Episcopal Church founded the institution in 1995, and the Liberian Legislature chartered it in 1996. In contrast, The AMEZU began in 1983 with the establishment of the AME Zion School of Business Studies. The AME Zion Community College was founded in 1987 and offers Associate degrees in Criminal Justice Management, Law Enforcement, and Liberal Arts, among other things.The resignation of the two university presidents, according to Kollie, followed the policy of the National Commission on Higher Education (NCHE).The new policy states that; All Presidents and Vice Presidents for Academic Affairs (VPAAs) of various universities/colleges must possess a doctorate from an accredited university, and an Honorary Degree Holder is DISALLOWED to serve as President or Vice President for Academic Affairs (VPAA) at any Higher Education Institution in Liberia.The post by Martin Kollie on his Facebook page attracted 638 reactions, 425 comments, and 77 shares.Verification: The post was not only done by Martin. The Analyst Newspaper published an article including a Facebook account titled D. Clifford Russell, andThe Liberian Influence did a similar post on the two presidents.Clifford said Rev. Attah of AME University resigned his post as president following the new policy of the National Commission on Higher Education ( NCHE).Rev. Alvin Attah resigned from his position in response to the National Commission for Higher Education’s new policy requiring only Ph.D. holders to serve as presidents of universities and colleges in Liberia.According to Nana Queen, Rev Attah, Pastor of the Eliza Turner AME Church, on Sunday, February 20, said, I have not resigned my position as President of the AME University. The board of trustees, which is the decision-making board of the institution, has not received any letter of resignation from me, nor am I thinking about doing so.TSM contacted Dr. Alvin E. Attah, president of AMEU, who denied the claim, “All of my certificates and degrees were earned by hard work.Also, a press statement was issued by AMEZU on Monday, February 20, 2023, refuting the claim of Dr. Benjamin Lartey’s resignation.James Kromah, a professor at the University, posted this on his page, “Martin, this information is false and misleading. AMEU President Rev. Alvin Attah is still in charge of AMEU. There is no news about his resignation on or around the campus of AMEU this morning. Please recheck your facts and stop spewing lies and falsehood against peaceful citizens.”Conclusion: After our research, we can categorically state that neither University’s president resigned, contrary to what CACC campaign leader Martin Kollie said in his post on February 17.Nevertheless, we cannot determine whether the two presidents are competent.                                                                                                                                                     by: Maima WrightRelated ",21/02/2023,https://tsmliberia.com/no-ameu-and-amezu-presidents-havent-resign/,0
No Record That Boakai-Cummings Ticket Seals,The Stage Media-Liberia,"Claim: Joe Boakai and cummings ticket sealsVerdict: FalseFull Text: A social media blog name Today Liberia TV posted February 10 that former Vice President Joseph Breaking and Alternative Natiobal Congress political leader has decided to contest as a team.The post attracts 454 reactions, 450 comments, and 60 shares.The post said, “Breaking News Joe Boakai and Cummings ticket seals..Report says Members of the opposition (Joseph Boakai and Alexander Cummings) have almost completed talks leading to a full collaboration for the 10 October elections this year.Our source disclosed that Alexander Cummings of the Alternative National Congress (ANC) has accepted to go as running mate to former Vice President Joseph Boakai for the Presidential ensuing Election.According to our source, Mr. Cummings accepted the offer based on several conditions including equity distribution of jobs among the two parties and most importantly for the Former VP to run for only one term thus giving the ANC the opportunity to lead.The supporters of the both men have had bad blood for each other from the deformation of the CPP , where one party accused the other of tempering with their framework document.”The post comes as Liberia goes to elections October this year to elect new President.Verification: The post was done not only by the social Media blog but also by Marc Jabateh, Exclusive Online TV, Shine TV and Map TV. All these posts attracted many comments, reactions, and shares.TSM contacted Fubbi Henries, Executive of the ANC; he debunked the claim adding that the claim is far from reality. He says there has been no discussion to that effect.Similarly, we contacted Mohammed Ali, former secretary general Unity Party, to confirm the information. He also terms the information as false and says there has been no discussion of such to the best of his knowledge.We also checked the official facebook pages of Boakai’s and Cummings, and we found no such information to confirm the claim.Recently, Boakai, in a VOA interview, said one political party could not defeat President George Weah, who is contesting for the second term.Boakai stressed the need for the opposition community to form a common front.Meanwhile, Boakai and r Cummings remain the forerunners in the opposition. However, their chances of replacing incumbent Weah depend not on their formidability but on the strength of the ticket they forge. Some believe only a Boakai-Cummings ticket can unseat the incumbent.In a piece of analysis, Taa Wongbe, former aide to Cummings, said that what the Liberian people want as an alternative to Weah is a Boakai-Cummings ticket.He noted that Cummings could not win the 2023 elections alone, especially with Boakai in the race. He called on Cummings to prove his love for country by seconding Boakai for unseating Weah in October.“CDC’s first 200,000 votes will come from Montserrado. Boakai’s first 200,000 votes will come from Montserrado and Lofa. No one knows where Cummings first 100,000 votes will come from,” he said.Conclusion: Despite suggestions that the two work together in the next elections in October, it is true that there is no record of the two political figures agreeing to run on a single ticket.

SONA: Weah’s Claim on Anti-Graft Institution Budget is Incorrect,Bettie Johnson-Mbayo,"In his State of the Nation Address in 2023, President George Weah stated that his administration had boosted fiscal assistance for the General Auditing Commission and the Liberia Anti-Corruption Commission (LACC).He claims the LACC would receive the most significant financing share in its history in the projected 2023 budget.“My Government has increased budgetary support to both the General Auditing Commission and the LACC. In the proposed budget, the LACC will receive the highest share of funding it has ever had in its history.”The Act of August 2008? establishing the LACC gives the Commission a broad mandate and functions to implement appropriate measures and undertake programs geared toward investigating, prosecuting and preventing acts of corruption in both the public and private sectors of Liberian society, including educating the public about the ills of crime and the benefits of its eradication.While the GAC is the Supreme Audit Institution of Liberia, an independent employer, and an independent public commission responsible for the audits of all public entities and funds owned or controlled by the Government to enable reporting as required by the GAC 2014 Act.The GAC has an extensive audit scope; section 2.1.3 (a) & (b) of the GAC Act of 2014 mandates the Auditor General to audit the consolidated accounts, but they may choose other audits. Public entities also include organizations such as the Central Bank of Liberia, banks with state equity, programs, activity, or function that are subject to audit by the General Auditing Commission.We compiled the budget data from 2011-2023.Conclusion: President Weah’s allegation is false; the LACC budget in 2012/13 was 9, 244,949; in 2014/15, it was 2701,640; in 2015/16, it was 2678,750; in 2016/17, it was 2386,116, and in 2023 it is 2,348,652.This suggests that the LACC has been allotted a significant budget four times before 2023.

Does the Legislature have a Website?,Mark Mengonfia,"Capitol BuildingImage Credit: FPAClaim: Liberian Legislature has a functional websiteVerdict: FalseFull text: Naymote, a Civil Society Organization (CSO), recently released a report that captured the promises of President George M. Weah; another report showed the workings of the legislative branch of the Liberian government.It detailed the number of promises made by President Weah, the ones he has achieved, and those that are yet to be fulfilled.Also, the institution looked deep into the Legislature with a focus on many other things, including the ratio of men to women, the number of legislation passed by both houses, the budget of the Legislature, and the number of public and secret sessions held.After the report on the Legislature, the Director of Communication at the House of Representatives, Robert Haynes, in a phone conversation on Truth FM State of the Nation Talk Show, termed the report false.During the appearance of the Naymote team, who claimed that the Liberian Legislature does not have a website was when Haynes phoned in.Naymote said despite substantial financial support to the Legislature, the body does not have any regular (official) publications on its activities or an active, official website for public information.However, Naymote recommends that the Liberian Legislature set up a functional website and ensure voting records are made public.In response to Naymote’s January 25, 2023, radio appearance, Haynes said the report was untrue.He claims Naymote’s report is to satisfy donor partners “The institution haveto write anything they want to write about the legislature.”When asked about the official website of the Liberian Legislature, Mr. Haynes said the functional website of the Liberian Legislature is www.legislatureofliberia.com.He also pointed out the Legislature’s Facebook page, which provides prompt public information.TSM researched the link www.legislatureofliberia.com, and it took us to several associations, including Wikipedia, WorldAtlas, Executive Mansion, and the Liberiainfo.We reached out to Facebook and established that the Liberian Senate has its own Facebook page with 4.5 thousand followers. The House of Representatives also has a Facebook page with 5.1 thousand followers.Conclusion: With the study completed, it is reasonable to claim that the House of Representatives director of press misrepresented the facts. The Legislature does not have a functioning website. However, the House of Representatives does have a Facebook page.

SONA: Did Weah Get Facts Right on Economy?,Bettie Johnson-Mbayo,"President George Manneh Weah, in his sixth State of Annual Address for his first term, made these claims about inflation and the economy:Today, Liberia is a macroeconomic exception in the West African region.We have brought inflation down from a high of thirty (30%) percent to a single-digit rate now under seven (7%) percent. We accomplished this in just under two years, making it one of the fastest rates of inflation collapse recorded. Inflation in End-December 2022 was 6.9% percent, and the exchange rate between the Liberian dollar and the United States Dollar has remained stable within the range of 150 – 153 for the past twelve (12) months.We verify these statements in sections.Macroeconomic Exception in the West AfricanThe Weah administration took office in 2018 following the end of the economist Ellen Johnson Sirleaf regime.Macroeconomics is the growth, inflation, employment, fiscal situation, and external debts.Growth rates differ considerably over time and across West African countries.The West Africa Economic Outlook 2019 states that Liberia and Sierra Leone recovered from the Ebola outbreak, which caused their economies to contract in 2014–16.“Since then, growth in Liberia has accelerated to 2.5 percent in 2017 and an estimated 3.2 percent in 2018. Sierra Leone has followed the same pattern, despite flooding in 2018. Growth rates in both countries are projected to return to pre-outbreak levels in 2019 and 2020.”The World Bank projected Economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) to slow from 4.1% in 2021 to 3.3% in 2022, owing to a slowdown in global growth, rising inflation exacerbated by the Ukraine war, adverse weather conditions, a tightening of global financial conditions, and an increase in the risk of debt distress.Though the Liberian economy recovered in 2021 from COVID-19, GDP is estimated to have recovered by 3.3% from a decline of 3.0% in 2020.Conclusion: According to the Macroeconomic performance and prospects 2019 report, Liberia had a floating or managed float system from 2008 and 2018.Furthermore, the IMF stated that, despite delays in the broad-based reform plan, Liberian authorities are continuing to implement prudent macroeconomic policies.“In general, the authorities kept the program on track by ensuring macroeconomic stability, a comfortable international reserve position, and debt sustainability.”There is no reason to believe Liberia is a West African macroeconomic outlier.2. INFLATIONWe have brought inflation down from a high of thirty (30%) percent to a single-digit rate that is now under seven (7%) percent. We accomplished this in just under two years, making it one of the fastest rates of inflation collapse in recorded economic history.2a. We have brought inflation down from a high of thirty (30%) percent to under seven (7%) percent.Before the election of President Weah, the inflation rate was 13.9 percent in January 2018, but it has since risen to 31.3 percent in August 2019.Then the Liberian Central Bank shifted from its former monetary policy framework to the current monetary targeting framework.Since its implementation, the present framework has demonstrated considerable effectiveness in combating inflation, as seen by a large drop in inflation from the high double digits to the single digits (from 30.55 percent in October 2019 to 5.46 percent in December 2021).Despite this gain, the domestic economy remains vulnerable to shocks that significantly influence the conduct of monetary policy, said in the West African Financial and Economic Review, June 2022 edition.In its country economic assessments for 2022, the IMF praised the Liberian government for its challenging and effective governance initiatives and policies that have maintained mainly macroeconomic stability.“Lowering inflation within single digits and maintaining a positive real GDP growth of 3.7% despite the enormous economic challenges facing the world at the time, such as COVID and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.The CBL Harmonized Consumer Price Index (HCPI), a composite of the Classification of Individual Consumption by Purpose (COICOP), forecasts 6-9 percent inflation in 2022 from January to December.While the IMF places the Annual Percent Inflation rate, average consumer prices to 8.7 in 2022.On his social media page, former Minister of Finance Amara Konneh commended the government for improving the macroeconomic situation but said, “The government needs to do more to combat food inflation.”Conclusion: True, inflation has dropped to a single digit in the last two years, but given the disparities in percentages from the World Bank, CBL, and IMF, it is safe to say that even though inflation has dropped, we have yet to see inflation fall below 7%.2b. fastest rates of inflation collapse in recorded economic historyFrom 2020 to 2022, we compare inflation rates in Liberia 9.9 to neighboring countries such as Ghana, Cote D’ Ivoire, Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Nigeria.Countries202020212022Liberia27178.7Ghana9.91020.9Cote D’ Ivoire2.44.24Sierra Leone11.525.926.8Guinea12.612.712.2Nigeria1718.917.3Table of Neighboring Countries Inflation ratesAccording to the World Bank, global headwinds are hurting Africa’s economic growth as countries grapple with growing prices, impeding progress toward poverty reduction.Meanwhile, the IMF said despite Liberia’s growth in 2022, the impending political cycle, which includes presidential and parliamentary elections in October 2023, is another source of concern.The international body recommends Liberia fully implement initiatives to enhance the business climate and increase credit availability, notably by expediting the resolution of non-performing loans. Improving educational attainment, tackling gender inequities, and adjusting to climate change is also crucial.ConclusionThere is no evidence that Liberia has seen the fastest rate of inflation drop in recorded economic history.3. Inflation at End-December 2022 was 6.9% percentFalse; according to the IMF for 2022, Liberia’s inflation rate is 8.7 percent, whereas AFDB puts it at 9.8 percent. Because the Liberia Financial Statistics (LFS) is a bi-monthly database published by the CBL, the CBL has not reported for December 2022.3a. The exchange rate between the Liberian dollar and the United States Dollar has remained stable within the range of 150 – 153 for the past twelve (12) months.No, the rate has been between 144.9386 – 157.94 for buying and selling, according to CBL.Related ",09/02/2023,https://tsmliberia.com/sona-did-weah-get-facts-right-on-economy/,0
Explainer: Liberia and Inconsistent COVID-19 record,Mark Mengonfia,"Screenshot of WHO Twitter post Claim: WHO led the way in Liberia, achieving the Highest COVID-19 vaccination rate.Full text: What is believed to be a conflicting report about Liberia’s efforts in fighting against COVID-19 has been lingering on social media, including Twitter and Facebook.Recently, the Ministry of information published on its official Facebook page stating that< 80% of Liberians are Vaccinated against COVID-19< 7th best in Africa containing COVID-19.< Liberia is the 3rd best-performing country in containing COVID-19 in West Africa. These claims were fact-checked.But Another report was posted by the World Health Organization WHO Liberia on its Twitter account Thursday, January 26, 2023.In that Twitter post, WHO Liberia quoted the United States of America Ambassador to Liberia- Micheal A. McCarthy.The post said, “A fruitful partnership with WHO, where WHO led the way in Liberia achieving the HIGHEST COVID-19 vaccination rate. It’s a pleasure working with professional & trustworthy people. If we do it again, WHO will be the way- U.S. Ambassador to Liberia- Micheal A. McCarthy.”Verification: “As of January 4, 2023, Seychelles was the African country with the highest coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccination rate, with around 205 doses administered per 100 individuals. Mauritius and Rwanda followed with 201 and 190 doses per 100 people, respectively. Ranking fourth, Morocco had a vaccination rate of approximately 148 doses per 100 people, registering the third-highest number of inoculations after Egypt and Nigeria. In South Africa, the most affected country on the continent, the vaccination rate instead reached around 64 per 100 population.No recent World Health Organization website data points to Liberia achieving the HIGHEST COVID-19 vaccination rate.During the heat of the virus outbreak, Reuters started collecting daily COVID-19 infections and deaths data for 240 countries and territories worldwide, updated regularly throughout each day. The last time Reuters posted information tracking Liberia’s COVID-19 diseases, death, and doses of vacation was July 15, 2022.As of 02 Sep 2022, according to the Multilateral Leaders Task Force On COVID-19, Liberia’s Maximum Vaccination Rate was put at 1.73 (Per 100 people), while the average Vaccination Rate was 1.06 (Per 100 people).To further establish the truthfulness or the falsity of the information, The New York Times latest Tracking Coronavirus Vaccinations Around the World and Liberia recorded the following: vaccinated- 79% fully vaccinated-76% there was no data about per 100 people.The New York Times data was published on January 15, 2023.The World Health Organization ( WHO) dashboardputs the vaccine doses administered per 100 population for Liberia at 88.2% and 73.77% for persons fully vaccinated with the last dose of primary series per 100 population while those who have taken booster recorded 0.04%Screenshot from the World Health Organization dashboard capturing Liberia’s percentageIvory Coast (Côte d’Ivoire) also has the following information: Total vaccine doses administered per 100 population is 92.04%, persons fully vaccinated with last dose of primary series per 100 population45.36 while 9.68 goes for Persons Boosted per 100 population.Screenshot from the World Health Organization dashboard capturing Ivory Coast gains in the COVID-19 fightConclusion: With the above data, TSM can state that Liberia does not have the HIGHEST COVID-19 immunization rate in West Africa, Africa, or the globe. The Highest, on the other hand, is a superlative form that contrasts differences between two items being changed.Ivory Coast, which borders Liberia, has 92.04% of total vaccination doses provided per 100 people, whereas Liberia has 88.2%.

Is Education Minister Right on 1.4 million children In School?,The Stage Media-Liberia,"Claim:1.4-million children enrolled in schools across Liberia Verdict:  False Full Text: Deputy Education Minister for Administration Latim Da-Thong, says there are 1.4 million children enrolled in schools across Liberia since the inception of Weah’s administration. According to him, as of 2030, Liberia will have about two million children in school.
Da-Thong stated that the Ministry expects an additional 480 thousand young people into the Liberian education sector in the next eight years.  He spoke during his appearance on OK FM 99.5 on January 25, 2023, in Monrovia. Liberia’s official primary school entrance age is six years old, while secondary education typically lasts until eighteen. 
The academic year runs from September to June. The Liberia Education Law of 2001 made primary education accessible and required for all pupils. The New Education Reform Act of 2011 made primary education accessible and needed for all Liberians through the ninth grade. President George Weah named Da-thong as one of the initial appointees on January 26, 2018.
Verification: An investigation by the Stage Media Liberia established that the World Bank puts primary school enrollment at 607,558.
For the academic year 2020–2021, student enrolment at public and private institutions has been incredibly low, according to Felecia Doe Somah, deputy minister for early childhood education.
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Education Sector Analysis 2022 shows that the Gross enrollment rate in Liberia currently is 881,131.
Enrollment at the lower primary level decreased by more than 50,000 students from 2015 to 2019/20, while all other levels witnessed slight increases in overall enrollment.
Furthermore, despite the large proportion of over-age students observed across sub-sectors, the alternative education sector remains small, with 13,000 students enrolled in ALPs in 2019/20, representing just over 2 percent of primary enrollment.
Public schools are the most common providers in the pre-primary (44%) and lower basic (44%) levels; nevertheless, they are the majority at the upper basic (27%) and secondary (22%) levels. Furthermore, since 2015, the proportion of kids enrolled in public schools has fallen across all levels, with growing participation in community- and faith-based institutions.

"False, No Increment in Doctor’s Salary",The Stage Media-Liberia,"PC: Partners in HealthClaim: “Increment in doctors’ monthly salary from US$700 to US$2,000.”Verdict:Full Text: The government of Liberia, through The Ministry of Information Cultural Affairs and Tourism( MICAT), has released its years in review covering 2018-2022 on January 13, 2023.The reviews, among several things, outlined various achievements made by President George Weah’s administration, among which it was noted that doctors’ monthly salary was increased from US$700 to US$2,000.Healthcare workers begin working for the Government of Liberia as contract employees and receive remunerations at the health facility where they work, via check and cash, as incentive pay.Verification: TSM contacted Lawrence Fahnbulleh, Director of Press and Public Affairs at MICAT, on January 17, 2023, to request supporting proof of the claim.He said, “We (MICAT) are not the ones that compose the document; It came from the sector ministries. So, visit the sector ministry to learn more.”We also contacted Dr. Alberta Clarke, President of the Liberia Medical and Dental Council (LMDI), but she refused a mobile interview requesting an in-person interview.She later declined the interview and refused to be recorded becausery of Health (MOH) should be contacted instead of the LMDI.” According to her, MOH would be more on point than her.Felecia Gbesioh, Communication Director of the Ministry of Health, contacted by TSM on the claim, and she termed it FALSE.Gbesioh said she spoke with the Minister of Health, Dr. Wihelminah Jallah, who told her that they (MOH) are presently validating the documents of doctors who are leaving from one level to the next. “Upon completion of the validation process, an increment will be done on staff salaries across the board on different levels and She told me they have not increased any specific person’s salary,” Gbesioh said.At the same time, Dr. Wilheminah Jallah stated during the sixth convocation of the Liberia College of Physicians and Surgeons that steps are being taken to review the salary structure of healthcare workers, from doctors to the lowest person in the sector.We contacted two doctors who said this:“Our salary is very discouraging. For me right now in my family, I can tell anyone in my family right now that I don’t want to be a doctor; I don’t want you to go near the health sector. Because the place we’ve found ourselves we’re like slaves.” Dr. Albert BrownRita Dahn said, “That little pocket change for others is our salary. It doesn’t come on time. The sector we’ve found ourselves in, you want a salary and it is o little to cater to your needs.”In 2019, Doctors also petitioned lawmakers to reduce their salaries and benefits.Conclusion: MICAT’s claim that a doctor’s monthly income has increased from US$700 to US$2,000 is False.

SONA: Is Liberia’s Land Act Africa’s Most Progressive?,The Stage Media-Liberia,"In his sixth annual message to the legislature on January 30, President George Weah stated that the Liberia Land Rights Act is widely regarded as the most progressive pro-community land reform law on the African continent.Because it recognizes and protects customary land tenure and women’s land rights.” I applaud you for passage of the Land Rights Act and the Local Government Act in your first session in 2018. The Land Rights Act has been considered by many as the most progressive pro-community land reform law on the African continent, as it recognizes and protects customary land tenure, as well as women’s rights to land.”President George Weah signed the Land Rights Act into law in September 2018, heralding it as a “landmark victory” by activists.In January 2018, Weah’s inauguration speech promised “clarity on fundamental matters such as the ground beneath their feet,” and many citizens felt a lengthy fight was coming to an end.The law applies to all land in Liberia, including private, public, government, and customary land.The Liberia Land Authority can enact the rules required to carry out this law.In Rwanda, the government passed a law in 1999 granting women equal inheritance rights to men, overturning previous beliefs that only male children may inherit.This has made it possible for widows and female orphans of the 1994 massacre to own land.According to the Kenyan Constitution (Republic of Kenya, 2010, article 61), the land is categorized into three categories. The Community Land Act 2016 (Republic of Kenya, 2016) establishes a new framework for identifying and registering customary holdings.The act states that any community may get a single collective title to its lands and control this property by established gender equity criteria.While Malawi has been engaging in a lengthy process of establishing new institutional frameworks for customary land administration.The Malawi National Land Policy (Government of the Republic of Malawi, 2002) sought to ensure that all Malawians had equal access to land.In 2016, this concept was formalized in ten law bills, including the Customary Land Act.This statute recognizes and allows for the registration of customary land in matrilineal or patrilineal societies.Because community-owned customary land can be titled and registered, it should protect against land grabs by local elites and foreigners.The tenure system for Senegalese land includes three overlapping legal systems: a customary system (derived from old customs), the registration system, and the French civil code system (as introduced by the colonial government).With Law 64-46, known as the national domain law, the Senegalese government attempted to integrate the three systems in 1964.Land was separated into three types under this land reform: state land, private land, and national land.State land (which comprised only 3% of Senegal’s land in 1964) is owned by the state and is divided into public and private land (the state can sell these private lands).Individuals with a land title own private land (which made up only 2% of Senegal’s land in 1964).Unlike land in the national domain, this land can be the subject of land transactions (sale, leasing, pledge, etc.).In nations with highly developed land markets, land ownership often indicates “full ownership,” which includes the whole set of rights owned by the landowner, including the right to transfer or dispose of (as in freehold) (e.g., Kenya and Malawi, with restrictions).Those that recognize several types of tenure, such as individual property rights, customary tenure, and public lands (e.g., Uganda and Sierra Leone); and countries that vest land ownership in the state and grant individuals only usage rights (e.g., Ethiopia, Nigeria, Tanzania).Given these changes, the data indicate significantly different rights in different nations, depending on the prevailing customary and statutory legal frameworks.According to another report, more than 90 percent of Africa’s rural land is undocumented, making it especially vulnerable to land grabbing and expropriation with little compensation.Several land reforms have been initiated in Ghana by successive administrations to make the industry more effective through land tenure security and more significant agricultural investment.As a result, since 2003, land reforms in Ghana have mainly concentrated on reforming the land administration apparatus.The Land Administration Program (LAP), Ghana’s most recent land reform program, seeks to streamline customary land administration systems to improve land tenure security and revenue mobilization from traditional land.As a result, since 2003, land reforms in Ghana have mainly concentrated on reforming the land administration apparatus.The Land Administration Program (LAP), Ghana’s most recent land reform program, seeks to streamline customary land administration systems to improve land tenure security and revenue mobilization from traditional land.The Global Land Governance Index (LANDex) assesses land governance on three levels(i)the legal and institutional framework surrounding a land issue; ii) the extent to which policies or programs established in such frameworks have been implemented; and iii) the diverse outcomes, impact, or perceptions of implemented projects or policies.The commitment on locally managed ecosystems has a score of 82.9 in Liberia, whereas good small-scale farming gets a score of 34.8.On the other hand, the head of the government agency in charge of the land policy stated that implementation is challenging.Despite Liberia, the land rights Law authority says implementing the law remains a nightmare.Under the law, the government said communities could claim ownership of customary land by presenting evidence such as oral testimonies, maps, and signed agreements with neighbors.A maximum of ten percent of the customary land in each community will be set aside as public land, and a nationwide survey will be conducted within two years.Gerald D. Yeakula, researcher and lawyer, said the Land Rights Act is progressive on paper, contrary to the President’s claim.“However, I cannot say for certain that it is the most progressive on the continent. Besides, what is important is the impact of the law.”“Nearly 5 years after the passage of the LRA, processes involving tribal certificates and giving title deeds to community are yet to substantially progress. Community land management structures to manage land are yet to be operational in most communities.”However, based on information from Ghana, Malawi, and Kenya, it is safe to declare that the Liberia Land Law Right Act is not the most progressive in Africa; even though land portal reported this, a disclaimer is provided.The Land Portal Foundation (A) expressly disclaims the accuracy, adequacy, or completeness of any data and (B) shall not be liable for any errors, omissions or other defects in, delays or interruptions in such data, or for any actions taken in reliance thereon.

"FALSE, 80% of Liberians not vaccinated Against COVID-19",Mark Mengonfia,"COVID-19 reinfection in LiberiaAhead of President George’s sixth annual message on January 30, 2023, before the Legislature, the Ministry of Information, Cultural Affairs and Tourism (MICAT) disclosed achievements by the administration.MICAT, in a Facebook post, said80% of Liberians are Vaccinated against COVID-19Liberia is the 3rd best-performing country in containing COVID-19 in West Africa.7th best in Africa containing COVID-19.Liberia confirmed the first case of COVID-19 on March 16, 2020, and in April 2020.President George Weah declared a nationwide state of emergency with mandatory lockdown in several regions, including the capital, Monrovia, to combat the spread of the coronavirus.Following the COVID-19 outbreaks in Liberia and the identification of vaccinations as a COVID-19 control method, Liberia entered the COVAX vaccines facility, a platform made available by Gavi for low- and middle-income countries to access vaccine supplies.The Government, in coordination with the United Nations (UN), Donor Partners, the Ministry of Health, and the National Public Health Institute of Liberia (NPHIL), put in place the National Multi-sectoral Response Plan (NMRP) for COVID-19.WHO supports Liberia’s initial National Deployment and Vaccine Plan (NDVP) for the COVID-19 Vaccine and adoption of the guidelines, SOPs, and other training materials and eventual vaccine use.Liberia has received 1,303,200 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine from the COVAX facility and other donors. Of these, 288,000 doses were of AstraZeneca, while 1,015,200 were of Johnson and Johnson products.Out of 400,893 vaccinated with J & J, 69,705 were fully vaccinated with AstraZeneca.As of January 20, 2023, about the time the claims were made, there have been 663,640,386 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 6,713,093 deaths, reported to the World Health Organization (WHO).The WHO shows that as of January 17, 2023, 13,131,550,798 vaccine doses have been administered, which amounts to 73.77 percent of the Liberian population.On the claim that Liberia has the 3rd best performance in containing COVID-19 in West Africa and 7th best in Africa.Research done by TSM did not show any data that Liberia has the 3rd best performance in containing COVID-19 in West Africa and 7th best in Africa.The Africa Report quoted Lowy Institute graded Rwanda, Togo, and Tunisia as the African countries that have responded best to Covid, far ahead of South Africa and especially many rich countries.Additionally, according to the World Street Journal January 1, 2021 publication about countries that have responded best to Covid-19, Taiwan showed up as the best.Liberia was listed as Best at learning from recent epidemics.However, nowhere is Liberia named as the 3rd best performance in containing COVID-19 in West Africa and the 7th best in Africa.Screenshots from World Health Organization and Wikipedia show different figuresConclusion: Though Liberia has made progress in the fight against the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) but research done, it is safe to say that the claims80% of Liberians are Vaccinated against COVID-19Liberia is the 3rd best-performing country in containing COVID-19 in West Africa.7th best in Africa containing COVID-19 are False.Related ",27/01/2023,https://tsmliberia.com/false-80-of-liberians-not-vaccinated-against-covid-19/,1
Explainer: What To Know About Liberia’s Poverty Reduction Ratio,Mark Mengonfia,"Claim: The Government of Liberia Reduced Extreme Poverty By 8% Over The Last Years

Full Text: The Ministry of Information Culture Affairs and Tourism took to its official Facebook page to highlight the Weah’s administration achievements in the last five years (2018-2022) in which it claimed that the government was able to reduce extreme poverty by 8% in 2022 as compared to the previous regime since he assumed office in 2018.

The Ministry’s list of achievements comes days before President Weah’s sixth Annual Message on January 30, 2023, otherwise called the State of the Nation Address (SONA).

The first was delivered in January 2018, a week after his inauguration as Liberia’s 25th President.

It is in line with Article 58 of the Constitution of Liberia, which states, “The President shall, on the fourth working Monday in January of each year, present the administration’s legislative program for the ensuing session, and shall once a year report to the Legislature on the state of the Republic. In presenting the economic condition of the Republic, the report shall cover expenditure and income.”

The Ministry claim, “The government of Liberia reduced extreme poverty by 8% over the last year, data from the world poverty lab.”

Verification: The government unveiled the Pro-Poor Agenda for Prosperity and Development 2018 to 2023 (PAPD).

It is the second in the 5-year National Development Plans (NDP) anticipated under the Liberia Vision 2030 framework. 

It follows the Agenda for Transformation 2012-2017 (AfT). It is also informed by lessons learned from implementing the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy 2007 (iPRS) and the Poverty Reduction Strategy (2008-2011).

The fundamentals underpinning the PAPD are i) Liberia is rich in human and natural resources, but ii) it is deprived of development largely because its human capital lacks the knowledge to transform the natural resources into wealth—whether through farming, mining, fishing, or other productive ventures that require technology or financial investments.

According to Poverty Lab 2022, our investigation places the population at 5,3343,515, even though the 2022 census result is yet to be published.

The poverty Lab report shows that  people living in extreme poverty are 1,865,224 constitute 35%.

People living in extreme poverty in 2017 were 1,658,482 (36%) and the threshold in rural areas was 1,449,695 (69%) and the urban regions amounted to 254,923 (9%) Poverty Lab.

The data shows one percent reduction in poverty as compared to 2017. 

The African Development Bank states that Extreme poverty remained high, at 43.0% in 2021, marking just a 1.0% decline from 2020.

While the Human Development Report refers to 2019/2020 estimates 52.3 percent of the population in Liberia (2,662 thousand people in 2020) is multidimensionally poor.

An additional 23.3 percent is classified as vulnerable to multidimensional poverty (1,186 thousand people in 2020). 

Conclusion:  As per our research, the information by the government that it has reduced extreme poverty by 8% over the last year is False.

Under GMW, it is 1 Doctor to 20,000 Patients according to WHO’s 2021/2022 HWF Report. It was 1:15,000 under EJS. Y’all go and put JorWeah there again. It will go up to 1:50,000. CRISIS!!”The post attracted 158 reactions, 64 comments, and 33 shares.Verification: The WHO World health statistics 2021report on the State of the Health Workforce in Africa, Liberia has one Doctor for every 20,000 people, far below WHO’s recommended 1:1,000 doctor-to-patient ratio.The WHO states that the density of medical doctors is highest in the European region, at around 43 per 10 000 population. Still, the African region has the lowest density of medical doctors (about 2 per 10,000 population).When the Liberia College of Physicians and Surgeons Graduated, Twenty-One Specialized Doctors confirmed that there is a low number of doctors to patients in the country.Conclusion: The information posted by Martin Kollie on the ratio of a Doctor to a patient is True.

Fact-Check: Is VP Taylor Correct On Census Claim?,Mark Mengonfia,"Claim: This is Liberia’s and West Africa’s first digital census.Source: Liberia’s Vice President, Jewel Howard-TaylorVerdict: Partly True and FalseFull text: Article 32(a) of the Constitution of Liberia mandates members of the Liberian Legislature to assemble in regular session once a year on the second working Monday in January.In keeping with the above, members of the Liberian legislature gathered early Monday, January 16, 2023, and performed all required for their return to the Capitol Building after their constitutional break.The Vice President is the President of the Liberian Senate who presides over proceedings of that august body.She spoke on various national issues highlighting the 2023 National Budget and delayed Pending Legislation with Committees and the National Census.Speaking on the National Census, she said,”I am proud to inform you that this 2022 census is a landmark initiative; because of the fact that this is Liberia’s and West Africa’s first digital Census.”The Census by the Liberia Institute of Statistics and Geo-Information Services (LISGIS) is by Section 6, Chapter 50A.8 of the LISGIS Act to further amend the new Executive Law, Title 12, of the Liberian Code of Law Revised.The objectives of the 2022 Census provide up-to-date information on demographics, economic and social amenities, know the present size and structure of the population and its spatial distribution among counties, districts, clans, cities, townships, and localities.It also provides a benchmark on which monitoring and evaluation of various national and international development goals could be based.The post by VP Taylor attracted 11 shares, 71 reactions, and 16 comments.Verification: TSM investigation established that Ghana was the first West African Country to conduct the digital Census in 2021. Ghana used a total of $84 million.Contrary to the Liberian Vice President, Ghana was the first West African Country in 2021 that conduct a digital census. Ghana first had its trial completed in select districts nationwide back in 2019.Countries out and in Africa that have conducted digital Census are Swaziland-April 29, 2017, Malawi-2019, Kenya-November 2019, and South Africa-August 10, 2020.Conclusion: The claim made by Vice President Taylor that the National Census is Liberia’s first digital Census is correct, but the claim that it is West Africa’s first digital Census is incorrect.

Explainer: Who sang the Nimba County Meet Song?,The Stage Media-Liberia,"Claim: President Weah dropped New Song for NimbaThe National County Sports Meet is one of the events in Liberia that brings sports lovers together to support their various counties to victory.Each year, the Ministry of Youth and Sports, Liberia’s sporting body, organizes the one-year sports meet with different categories, including Kickball (women’s game), Basketball, and football games.The Counties are arranged in stages, and the preliminary games are played in various counties at designated sports pitches.Nimba County is one of the Counties that qualified from the group stage- a stage that allows teams to come to the capital city-Monrovia to play at the Samuel Kanyon Sports Complex in quarter-finals, Semifinals, and grand finals.Nimba and Lofa Counties qualified from Group C of the Competition and played in the grand final.But before the grand final, a song about Nimba’s victory started making rounds in Liberia, and the music had the name and photos of President George Weah claiming he sang the song.The song was released a year ago, but recently, it has claimed attention because of the just-ended County Sports Meet.The song was posted 11 months ago by LB online TV and has generated 5.7 thousand views.Delicia Life and Travels also posted the song that attracted 18 thousand views a year ago.After Sunday, January 15, 2023, the grand final between Nimba and Lofa Counties, the song was heard at various entertainment centers and played on radio stations.The Stage Media-Liberia investigation established that Weah did not do the song. Instead, it was sung by Obediah Tokpah, a Nimba citizen living in Newcastle, Washington DC, USA.Tokaph released the Nimba Victory song one year ago, but it went wide in the 2022 NCSM before the grand final between Nimba and Lofa.He was screened live with De Licia Life N Travel when Tokpah pronounced that he was the song’s producer, not President Weah.“I want people to know that I wrote and sang the song, I don’t think I have to put on a disclaimer for my song, the song was sang for the President, I want people to promote the song and to give me the credit that I deserved.”screenshot of Obediah TokpahHe called on those who posed the song to give him(Tokpah) credit instead of the president.Besides the Nimba County victory song, Tokpah has released other music such as Thank you, Jesus, Fight, Lone Star, When You Rush, You Will Crush, and so on.Conclusion: Based on links to songs by Tokpah and a live video with De Licia Life N Travel, we conclude that Tokpah is the proper owner of the music, not the president.Another thing is that the song was not released this year but a year ago- 2022.By Mark N.

Fact-Check: Is electricity sold for 15 cents per KWH?,Bettie Johnson-Mbayo,"Claim: In 2017, one kWh was sold for 39 cents. Today, under George Weah, one kWh is sold for 15 cents.Full Text: On January 2, 2023, a Facebook account Prisca Paul posted the above claim on his official page.The social media user claimed,” Simple things that matter: Back in 2017 under Joe Boakai’s government, the common people purchased electricity at 39 cents per kWh. Today, under George Weah, the same is sold for 15 cents per kWh.”The post published on Monday, January 2, attracted 60 reactions, 98 comments, and two shares.The Liberia Electricity Corporation (LEC) is a public utility created in 1973 by the Government of the Republic of Liberia. This entity was developed through an act of Legislature with a mandate to produce and supply economical and reliable electric power to the entire nation while at the same time maintaining the corporation’s financial viability.Liberia’s energy problems peaked in 2003 when the country’s long civil conflict left its energy sector— including its power distribution system and the 60-megawatt Mt. Coffee hydropower plant—destroyed.The national power utility, Liberia Electricity Corporation (LEC), ceased operations after its headquarters and distribution infrastructure was looted. To launch efforts to rebuild, the Government of Liberia began working with a group of donors in 2006 during the regime of former President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf.They established the Emergency Power Program, and within a year, the public network had 2 MW of diesel-powered generators.Eyeing a long-term solution, the government hired IFC in 2007 to structure a five-year, incentive-based management contract between the Government of Liberia and a private-sector partner, with support from an international group of donors led by Norway that included the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the World Bank’s Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid (GPOBA).The group designed a trilateral framework agreement, the management contract aimed at improving LEC’s operational and financial performance, rebuilding the electricity system in Monrovia, and significantly expanding Liberians’ access to power.The improved performance of LEC affected the entire sector, with donors extending grants and concessional finance to rebuild the Mt. Coffee hydro plant.Verification: In 2017, President Sirleaf Announced a Ten Percent (10%) Reduction in Electricity Tariff; in Liberia.The reduction in the tariff was $0.49 to $0.39 per kilowatt hour, beginning March 1, 2017.According to the President, the dropped in tariff, however, comes as a result of regional cooperation from TRANSCO CLSG – a regional electricity transmission company that is already turning on the switch in Ganta and Harper, to be followed by Zwedru and Fish Town, at an affordable price of twenty-five cents per kilowatt per hour.December 2021, the Liberia Electricity Regulatory Commission (LERC) Board Chairman, Dr. Lawrence Sekajipo, announced reductions in electricity tariffs beginning January 1, 2022.He said the new tariff would enable social customers, whose monthly energy consumption is either less than or equal to 50kWh, to pay US$0.15, representing a 32% reduction from the current price of US$0.22.Before the announcement, the Executive Director for Commercial and Regulatory at the LEC, Sam Zimbe, proposed to the Commission that the current residential prepaid tariff be reduced from US$.0.35 to US$.0.30.Residential post-paid from US$.0.35 to US$.0.30, commercial prepaid from US$.0.35 to US$.0.27, commercial post-paid from US$.0.35 to US$.0.27 and among others.Despite the announcement by the LERC, the LEC, on its current tariff site, says the provisional tariffs approved by the Commission on September 21, 2020, are revoked and replaced with the rates and charges.The commissions End-User Tariffs (EUT) provided in the table below are the rates and charges payable by customers within LEC’s network in the categories specified from January 1, 2022.TSM check established that in 2017, one kWh was sold at 39 cents. According to the Liberia Electricity Corporation, one kWh is sold for 0.24 cents plus Goods and Services Tax (GST) 10% of energy 0.024, which brings it to a total of 0.264 per kWh.Conclusion: Following our verification, the claim is Partly True; in 2017, one kWh was sold at 0.39 cents, and the claim that presently one kWh is sold for 0.15 cents is False.Related ",16/01/2023,https://tsmliberia.com/fact-check-is-electricity-sold-for-15-cents-per-kwh/,1
"Fact Check: This year, February won’t be the last  in...",Mark Mengonfia,"Claim: This coming February is the last February anyone living now will see.Verdict: apart from leap years, the days of the week in February all occur four times each, a pattern that repeats itself much more frequently than “once in a lifetime” or “every 823 years”.Full Text: Social media users are recycling an old myth about February, claiming it is scarce – “every 823 years” – to see each day of the week appear precisely four times on the calendar, as it did in 2022.The claim has circulated in dozens of online posts in Africa, suggesting that the combination of days in February 2022 was a divine occurrence and witnessed only once in a lifetime, or in some cases, every 823 years.The social media user backed their claim with the calendar of February 2023.“This is because this year’s February has the following that happens only once in 823 years. This year, February has: 4 Sundays, 4 Mondays, 4 Tuesdays, 4 Wednesdays, 4 Thursdays, 4 Fridays, and 4 Saturdays.”A similar claim was made in 2016: “This February cannot come into your life again. Because this year, February has 4 Sundays, 4 Mondays, 4 Tuesdays, 4 Wednesdays, 4 Thursdays, 4 Fridays, and 4 Saturdays- It was not the case as claimed after this check was done.2016 was a leap year, meaning one day repeated five times, and it was false.Even before then, other variations of the claim have circulated. A search for “once every 823 years” revealed the claim is a mixture of several myths related to the calendar.The social media user said the four of each day are called ‘MiracleIn,’ a team which, according to a user from Georgia, U.S., means “Miracle or by the hand of God.”Users additionally requested that the above message be sent to at least five people or 5 Groups, and a miracle would happen within four days because unexplainable biblical miracles back it.Verification: February has 29 days in leap years, one more than usual.Leap years are caused by the revolution of the Earth around the Sun, which naturally takes 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, and 46 seconds. The extra hours after 365 days are compensated with an additional day in February every four years.The claim was fact-checked by Latestly and VishvasnewFor instance, the last leap year was 2020, when February had 29 days. Five of those days were Saturdays, while other days of the week occurred just four times each.The simple mathematics about this claim that can help you quickly understand is that February has 28 days, and when divided by seven, each week has four days; that is, four Mondays, four Tuesdays, four Wednesdays, four Thursdays, and four Fridays-(28÷7=4).This occurrence will repeatedly appear as years pass by and not after 823 years, as claimed.The coming years show that 2024 February, which will be a leap year, will not have 4 of each day, but 2025 and 2026 will have 4 Sundays, 4 Mondays, 4 Tuesdays, 4 Wednesdays, 4 Thursdays, 4 Fridays, and 4 Saturdays.Conclusion: The claim is false: there is nothing special about February this year as claimed by the social media users; every day of the week appears four times – just as it does in all non-leap years.By Mark N.

"Explainer:  Information Minister Radio Appearance, What did he say?",The Stage Media-Liberia,"Claim: The Information Minister says he can’t see nor talk to the President; overall no money to run his Ministry( MICAT).Source: Drunk-NewsFull text: “ Social media blog named Drunk News on December 21, 2022 posted that Information Minister Legerhood Rennie said that he can’tsee nor talk to the President, overall, no money to run his Ministry of Information Cultural Affairs and Tourism ( MICAT).”The post made by Drunk-News attracted 206 likes, 93 comments, and 138 shares.Minister Ledgerhood Rennie was appointed on October 1, 2020, taking over from Lenn Eugene Nagbe, now Commissioner General of Liberia’s Maritime Authority.Recently, the Ministry has been criticized for failing to pay its workers after its former Minister Eugene Fahngon took to Facebook to say that it was paying as low as US$45.00 and witch-hunting workers.The workers protested at the Ministry in November of 2022 over Salary Deductions.November 14, 2022, release said the protest action is not the making of the Ministry’s senior management team.It is instead the result of a long-standing salary disparity with MICAT’s Payroll.Did the Minister Say No Money run MICAT?When TSM contacted Minister Rennie via WhatsApp to verify, he termed the entire post rubbish.TSM also sent him a video, but Minister Rennie did not respond even though he read the message via WhatsApp.However, in the video of a live interview with the Minister on OK Morning Rush on December 21, 2022, Rennie was squarely heard complaining of the lack of support to run the affairs at the Minister of Information, Cultural Affairs, and Tourism.“We are struggling to carry out our mandate; it means that what we expect to have to be able to do what is expected of us has not been forthcoming.”He continues, ” just to be frank, some of the criticism that we get comes from the fact that we just do not have it to do what is expected of us.”“The job is difficult now because of the lack of support,”“So it seems difficult from the outside, but it is not a difficult job when you have the support you need to get.”Minister Rennie furthered, “When you employ a coach, you give him the mandate to qualify a team for a particular tournament.”“Most times, people expect that I should be defending the government against things that have been said about the government; What the government is doing and how they are doing it, fair enough, but how do I do it; what is the budget that supports it?”Did the Minister Say He Couldn’t See or Talk to the President? The post by Drunk News of the Minister not seeing or talking with the President is partly true. The Minister did say in the interview, “I want to have a meeting with the president because I do not believe he is so aware of what is going on.”When quizzed by the interviewer that he should have unhindered access to the President, he said, “Yes, but we are in a political world, and certain things happened behind the scenes, so I do not want to talk about it.”Conclusion: Following our investigations, the post by Drunk News is Partly True. The information about Minister Rennie saying he cannot see nor talk to the President is partly true. At the same time, the information about the Minister on the lack of funds to run MICAT is True.

Explainer: What to know about President Weah’s trip to Paris Forum,The Stage Media-Liberia,"President Weah arrives in ParisBy Melvin Jackson [emailprotected]When President George Weah requested an extension of his trip to Paris, social media users and critics called him a liar and a criminal.“Why lie that the Paris forum was extended from November 18 and the official date was Nov 11-12? Shame on you, Jorweah. We will vote you out in 2023.According to the users, the Paris peace forum in France was never extended to November 18, as claimed by Liberia’s president George Weah. Hence, they claimed he (Weah) lied to the Liberian senate that the forum was extended from November 15-18, 2022.President George Weah’s communication to the Liberian senate, dated November 18, informed the August Body that the 5th Edition of the Paris Peace Forum had been extended to November 18.The big question here is, who is telling the truth? Did President George Weah attend the Paris Peace Forum in France on November 18 instead of the planned date of November 11 to 12?Research conducted by ‘The Stage Media’ proved that the conference was held from November 11-12 in the presence of France President Emmanuel Macron.This year’sParis Peace Forum, the 5thEdition of the annual event, focuses on the theme ‘Riding out the Multi-crisis.’The UNDPSDG Impactis among the 60 projects selected to be featured this year.The President did not lie about the extension of the Paris Peace Forum as speculated on social media.A stop followed the trip to Morocco in Egypt, where President Weah participated in the just-ended COP27, the United Nations Global Climate Change Conference, which kicked off on November 6, 2022, at the Tonino Lamborghini International Convention Center in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt.This conference ran from November 6 to 8, 2022, when the Liberian President left for Qatar to join some world leaders for the official opening of the FIFA World Cup 2022.According to two separate communications sent to the Liberian Legislature, President Weah told the August body that his trip is intended to hold a series of bilateral and multilateral meetings with his counterparts and business executives.He further revealed that the adjustment had necessitated his adjustment to attend the conference as a guest of honor to the official opening of the FIFA world cup in Qatar.President Weah Communication chief, Presidential Press Secretary Isaac Solo Kelgbeh, confirmed that the conference was held from November 11 to 12.He explained that the President requested an extension from the Liberian senate because his date schedule to meet with President Emmanuel Macron would have gone against his first communication sent to that august body.The Presidential Press Secretary added that the extension of time mentioned by the President in his communication included activities to the conference, as the President couldn’t have come back before going again to meet with his counterpart due to limited resources to sponsor such travel.The release also pointed out that the Paris Forum started on November 11 and climaxed on the 15th, but there were sideline meetings organized for heads of state to have met with president Emmanuel Macron.Conclusion: following our interview with the presidential press secretary and the research conducted, the President of Liberia did not lie to the Liberian senate about the extension of his stay in France, but the request for an extension was to hold multi-bilateral talks with his counterparts and business executives.Related ",04/01/2023,https://tsmliberia.com/explainer-what-to-know-about-president-weahs-trip-to-paris-forum/,0

Fact-Check: Did Min. Tweah Approve Cheque For Weah Without Seeing The...,The Stage Media-Liberia,"By: R. Joyclyn [emailprotected]Claim: On November 9, 2022, Drunk-news posted that Finance Minister Samuel Tweah said he signed President George Weah’s cheque to travel, but he didn’t see the amount.Source: Drunk-NewsVerdict: True; Minister Samuel Tweah said he did not see the amount he approved for President Weah’s recent trips.Full text: When Finance Minister Samuel Tweah appeared on Spoon FM, a widely monitored online TV and radio talk show, he told the hosts that he signed President George Weah’s cheque to travel but did not see how much was on it.The trip of Mr. Weah started on November 1, 2022, in Morocco, Egypt, where he addressed COP27 on November 9, 2022, and Qatar on November 18, 2022.The trip was extended to France and the United States, where he attended the Tuesday, December 13, 2022, second edition of the United States Africa Summit, dubbed the US-Africa Leaders’ Summit.How much is the President’s seven weeks’ budget out of the country? Tweah says he signed the cheque but didn’t see the amount.When Minister Tweah appeared on Spoon FM, the public had no idea of an extension of the President’s trip until a communication was sent to the Legislature requesting an additional 25 days.The post by Drunk-news attracted over 1.5k likes, 1.2k comments, and 81 shares.Verification: Smith Toby is the Deputy Presidential Press Secretary. He says the President’s official delegation is 17 on both trips to Egypt (eight persons) and Qatar (nine persons).He says this excludes the advance team, which constitutes the President’s security and representatives from line ministries and agencies of government.TSM has listened to the live interview on spoon FM in which the Minister admitted to not seeing the amount on the cheque for the President’s trips even though he approved it.“I was out of the country and I did not see anything. My office staff sees the amount and does all of the paperwork, my job is to ensure where the President has to go, he goes,”Tweah continues, “There is a lot of paperwork, a lot of things and I am not going to be looking at all of that. The President has several lances on the trip.”“The President’s allowances are calculated in several different budgets to be sent at different times, and different levels of approval, because it has different lances, and I will have to do that math and see, so I wouldn’t be able to say the amount.”During the interview, Tweah further disclosed that President George Weah is “entitled” to a $2,000 (£1,700) daily allowance for his trip, which includes a stop in Qatar for nine days to watch the FIFA World Cup.Tweah cited the Liberia Foreign Travel Policy Manual No. 14: “The President as head of the delegation shall be given in addition to the entitled accommodation and per diem an Incidental Allowance of US$2,000.00 for each day of stay abroad for any extra accommodation charges and other incidental expense irrespective of the country he/she is traveling to. This amount shall be accounted for, including submission of the relevant hotel and other receipts on return.”The Stage media also spoke with Eddie Jarwolo, Naymote Partners for Democratic Development Executive Director, who said the Minister’s action shows many hidden agendas.He requests the ministry to publicize the President’s numerous trips, specifically budgetary allocations to those trips.Conclusion: Research into the claim, based on the live interview with Spoon Fm and questions posed to Deputy Presidential Press Secretary Toby, The Stage Media concludes that Finance Minister Tweah did not give a projected amount of the President’s trip and at the same time, he said he did not see the amount in the cheque but approved it.Related ",14/12/2022,https://tsmliberia.com/fact-check-did-min-tweah-approve-cheque-for-weah-without-seeing-the-amount/,1

Having it all; fashion, pomp, pageantry, elegance, entertainment, thrills, and disappointment. The tragic civil war interrupted all this, stalling so much progress in Liberia, with Miss Liberia being no exception.Intermittently the pageant was held, each time allowing young women to hope and dream and allowing some of them to aspire to be known as the most beautiful, eloquent, and talented “Royalty” in Liberia.That start and stop era of Miss Liberia is now at an end. On July 23, 2022, Liberia prepares to see 15 beautiful young women grace the stage at the historic Centennial Pavilion for the first time in almost a decade.

Africa Facts Ends 2022 Summit,The Stage Media-Liberia,"By: R. Joyclyn WeaThe United States International University (USIU) in Nairobi was a place that connected all fact-checkers from across the continent at the November 2022 Africa Facts Summit.The two-day summit witnessed the coming together of over a hundred African fact-checkers to share their approaches to protecting users of their platforms from harmful content.The gathering was also geared towards building nonpartisan fact-checking on Africa.Mark Kaigwa advises fact checkers to value their reach(audiences) over engagement in the battle for the audience.Run through the different types of reach in data-constrained digital economics.“Many of us are fooled into forwarding tricks into sharing and confused by the trends,” Kaigwa told the gathering when presenting on the topic, reaching audiences online and offline.Dr. Halani Gumpo noted, “Thinking about impact as it relates to fact-checking is to set goals, understand your community, measure the engagement, and demonstrate impact.He added, “There is no universal measurable approach to tracking impact after a fact-check is done.”Demba Kandeh said Africa had changed significantly over the past decades.Kandeh noted, “This is in response to changing political, social-economic and legal environments around the continent and globally.”Paul Cunliffe Jones, the brain behind the foundation of Africa check, said false news laws are not the answer to information disorder, and a different approach is needed.The lack of easy access to accurate information,, he said if lawmakers are concerned about statistics, they will fund statistics agencies which will help fact-checking outlets to do their work.“It is important that fact-checkers focus on claims that politicians make because they have a pivotal role in society,” Jones added.He furthered that ten years ago, the practice of fact-checking was two people sitting around a desk, but today there are over 30 fact-check outlets.For his part, Jean Leroux said, “Disinformation and misinformation often go hand in hand, but the origin of the false information differs materially.”He highlighted the critical difference, tips, and tricks to differentiate disinformation from misinformation on social media platforms.The Facts checking summit was not only attended by institutions in the area of fact-checks.The Media Council of Kenya also joined fact-checkers at the Africa facts summit to discuss several topics on strengthening fact-checking in Africa. These included obstacles in the fight against misinformation, the importance of media literacy, and fact-checking in challenging environments.Also, during the summit, Stage Media co-Partners, Madam Bettie Johnson Mbayo presented on a topic, “ Show and Tell.”During this session, fact- checkers presented what they have done right and how they are doubling their games to improve on fact-checking in their various countries when it comes to double-checking facts.Related ",14/11/2022,https://tsmliberia.com/africa-facts-ends-2022-summit/,1

False! Weah never promised to implement war and economic crimes court...,The Stage Media-Liberia,"By Jackson Clay- Dubawa FellowPresident George Weah told the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in 2019 that he would have implemented the War and Economic Crimes Court upon his return.President Weah did not tell UNGA in 2019 that he would have implemented the war and economic crimes court for Liberia.Full textSince the end of the 14 years of civil unrest, Liberians at home and abroad have been calling for establishing of a war and economic crimes court to prosecute the country’s perpetrators of war and financial crimes.The plea for justice is summed up in astory published in 2021.Even the now-ruling Coalition for Democratic Change led government, while in opposition, was the key champion for the country’s war and economic crimes court.The party held a series of protests demanding that the then-ruling Unity Party (UP) establish the court, a call that did not materialise.After winning power, the party made a profound u-turn, as seenhere.Also, aTruth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC)was established by the TRC Act in 2005 to “promote national peace, security, unity and reconciliation.”It was also set-up to make it possible to hold perpetrators accountable for gross human rights violations and violations of international humanitarian law that occurred in Liberia between January 1979 and October 2003.Since the end of the war, not a single Liberian has been prosecuted for their role in the war. Instead, some of the perpetrators are now being rewarded with top government positions such as senators and representatives, leaving their victims wallowing in economic deprivation.Appearing on a talk show, theOkay Conversationaired on Okay FM on Monday, October 24, 2022, the national youth chairman of the opposition ruling Unity Party, Melvin Cephas, stated that President George Weah told the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in 2019 that he would implement the War and Economic Crimes Court upon his return.Cephas further stated, “After telling the UNGA in 2019 that he would have implemented the war and economic crimes court, President Weah got back here and did nothing in that direction but only for him to return this year to tell some Liberians in the United States that Liberia looks like Miami.”The show, which was carried live on the station’s Facebook page, had about four hundred comments, over four thousand viewers and over one hundred and ninety emojis, and this statement is made at2:23:1-18 secondsVerificationConsidering the importance of this claim and how sensitive it is for the people of Liberia, DUBAWA embarked on a fact-checking mission to investigate exactly what the Liberian leader told the UNGA in 2019.Through research, DUBAWA accessed thespeech delivered by President George Weah at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in 2019and found as follows; the nine-page statement covered a variety of issues including the global crisis, poverty eradication, and quality education.However, pages five to seven focused largely on the war crimes and how the Liberia people have dealt or intend to deal with it.“When I spoke before you last September, after my first 9 months in office, I indicated a preference for dialogue as a conflict-resolution mechanism, so that as a Government and People, we could together focus our efforts on poverty-reduction, growth, and economic development, rather than on retribution.“However, since that time, there has been a rising chorus of voices from many quarters calling for the establishment of an economic and war crimes court. These voices include thousands of war victims and some of the alleged perpetrators, who seem to wish to either clear their names or their conscience.“Support for the establishment of the court has also been voiced by many international organizations, as well as some of our international partners.“Mr. President, we are at a loss to understand why the clamor for the establishment of the court is now being made, almost a full decade after it was first called for, and during which time no such pressure was brought to bear on the government that grew out of the Accra Peace Accord,” the president stated.“Considering the importance of this matter, I have already begun consultations with our National Legislature – the representatives of our people – and we intend to have a broader engagement with the Liberia Judicial System and with our strategic International Partners and Organisations to determine pertinent issues such as legal framework, timing, venue, and funding, among others,” he added.DUBAWA read the speech delivered by the president at the UNGA and found no promise to implement a war and economic crimes court.DUBAWA also watched theentire address by President George Weah during the UNGA 2019presentation to be sure that what was in the script was exactly what was read by the president. From 10:49-16:19 portion of the video, the Liberian leader spoke about ways to bring lasting peace and stability to Liberia, just as in the script.At no point did he promise to implement war and economic crimes court.ConclusionEven though President George Weah spoke about the adverse impact of war crimes on the people of Liberia during his UNGA speech, he did not promise to implement the war and economic crimes court for Liberia.Related ",08/11/2022,https://tsmliberia.com/false-weah-never-promised-to-implement-war-and-economic-crimes-court-at-unga/,1
False! Public wage bill under former President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf was...,The Stage Media-Liberia,"Claim: Public sector wage bill size was increased to 70% of the country’s expenditure totaling $320 million under Johnson Sirleaf.

False! The last employee compensation under former President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf was 59%, not 70% of expenditure. Data from the 2017 to 2018 budget statement and a report from USAID nullify the claim.

Full Text
A known supporter of the Weah-lead administration has said the erstwhile government under President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf left behind an unsustainable wage bill. 

According to Samuel Jackson, an Economist, the wage bill under the former administration ballooned to 70%, amounting to $320 million. He said this left the government with little or no space for capital investment, which was essential in building post-war Liberia. 

He made the claim during a debate with Amos Tweh, Secretary General of the immediate past administration, the Unity Party.

The debate was held on a local radio station, Okay FM 99.5, and was carried live on the station’s Facebook page on September 19, 2022. 

The claim by Mr Jackson was made at two hours and five minutes of the almost three-hour show.

According to Jackson, due to this huge wage bill inherited by the CDC-led government, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) requested the Weah-led government reduce the country’s wage bill. He said this led to the government harmonization plan during the first two years of the Weah administration.

This action by the government led to a series of protests by some civil servants in the country.

Verification
The IMF defines the wage bill “as the total compensation, in cash or kind, payable to a government employee in return for work. It includes wages and salaries, allowances, and social security contributions made on behalf of employees to social insurance schemes (IMF, 2014b).”

According to the IMF working paper titled: Fiscal Implications of Government Wage Bill Spending, the higher the wage bill, especially in developing countries, the greater the fiscal imbalances.

With this in mind and the huge public interest this debate has generated, DUBAWA decided to investigate the claim made by Mr Jackson.

During the research, DUBAWA discovered that the last approved national budget of the country under former President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, 2017/2018 puts the size of the country’s wage bill at 59% of total expenditure, amounting to $298.020,404 million. This is found on page xiii (3) of the 2017/2018 approved national budget of Liberia.

Again, page two of the USAID report: Process mapping study, pay and payroll reform in the government of Liberia also confirms that the wage bill for the 2017-18 financial year was 57% of the Government of Liberia’s total expenditure. This is found under the caption ‘Fiscal Conditions.’ 

Conclusion    
Following an investigation into the claim, DUBAWA can conclude, based on official documents available, that Liberia’s wage bill in the final year of former President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf’s administration was not 70%. It was 59%, according to the budget statement of 2017-18.",31/10/2022,https://tsmliberia.com/false-public-wage-bill-under-former-president-ellen-johnson-sirleaf-was-never-70-of-total-expenditure/,1
Liberia peacekeeping ‘largest operation in Africa in the history of the...,Bettie Johnson-Mbayo,"While he got his numbers wrong, other experts agree with the economist in debating the legacy of the UN’s mission in Liberia.
There were at most 15,000 uniformed personnel in Liberia at the height of the UN’s operations in the country, not 17,000.
This is significantly fewer than in at least eight other African countries, including Somalia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Darfur in western Sudan.
Four years after United Nations (UN) peacekeepers officially left Liberia in 2018, debate still continues in the country over the legacy of the mission. 

The UN Mission in Liberia (Unmil) was deployed in 2003  and tasked with helping restore peace and security in Africa’s oldest modern republic following 14 years of civil war that claimed the lives of at least 200,000 people. 

After its creation peacekeeping authority passed from West African-led efforts.

In a September 2022 interview on private Liberian radio station OK FM, prominent economist Samuel Jackson made two claims about peacekeeping in the country. 

“In 2018 Liberia was not a utopia. Liberia was coming out of the largest peacekeeping operation in Africa in the history of the UN – 17,000 peacekeepers,” he said. (Note: The claim can be heard at 1:43 minutes in the video.)

Jackson, who was debating Amos Tweh, the secretary general of the Unity Party, was tracing some of Liberia’s modern-day struggles to the departure of the mission, and the financial hit the economy took. 

Jackson is backing president George Weah’s 2023 re-election bid, despite having been one of his fiercest critics. Weah leads the Congress for Democratic Change. 

But does his claim about peacekeeping add up? We checked.

‘Easily proven fact’
Contacted for the source of the claim, Jackson declined to comment on what he called “an easily proven fact”.

The UN defines peacekeepers as those who “provide security and the political and peacebuilding support to help countries make the difficult, early transition from conflict to peace”.

Peacekeepers include military, police, and civilian personnel.

Any person working in a UN mission is a peacekeeper, Alexandra Novosseloff, a senior visiting fellow at the International Peace Institute in New York City, US, told us. 

“But formally, most of the time, the UN security council looks only at uniformed personnel, even if the general assembly adopts the budget that also includes civilians,” she said. 

The powerful 15-member security council is tasked with ensuring global peace and security while the general assembly is the UN’s main policy-making organ.

UN peacekeeping is guided by three key principles:

Consent of the parties
Impartiality 
Non-use of force except in self-defence and defence of the mandate
Data shows, Somalia, DRC missions are the largest in Africa
The UN keeps publicly available data on its peacekeeping missions around the world. 

The data shows that the largest UN peacekeeping operations in Africa have been in Somalia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Sudan – not Liberia.

In numbers: UN peacekeeping missions in Africa
Country	Mission name	Number of peacekeepers
Somalia	Unosum	28,000
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)	Monusco	20,586
Darfur	Unamid	20,871
DRC (1961)	Onuc	19,828
South Sudan	Unmiss	19,075
Mali	Minusma	17,612
Sierra Leone	Unamsil	17,500
Central African Republic	Minurca	16,241
Liberia	Unmil	15,000
Source: UN Peacekeeping 
In 2021 the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the DRC (Monusco) had 16,316 uniformed personnel. This figure includes military personnel, police, and personnel of formed police units. 

In 2020 the number was 20,586. Prior to July 2010, the mission was known as the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, or Monuc.

The peacekeeping operation in Darfur in western Sudan had 19,248 uniformed personnel. Unamid, as the operation was known, ended its activities in December 2020. (Note: You can read about that conflict here.)

At its height, Unmil – the UN’s operation in Liberia – had 15,000 uniformed personnel, and not 17,000 as claimed by Jackson. 

“Unmil was never the largest UN mission,” Novosseloff confirmed to us. She said the ones in the DRC and Darfur were larger.

Dr. Lise Morjé Howard, a senior scholar-in-residence at the US Congress-backed Institute of Peace, said: “No, Unmil was not the largest mission. Generally only ‘blue helmets’ count as peacekeepers.”

A “blue helmet” is military personnel who wears the UN peacekeeper’s distinctive light blue helmet.

Was Liberia’s mission a success?

The legacy of the peacekeeping mission in Liberia continues to be debated. Some have highlighted the economic shock to the country following the mission’s exit.

Dr Lise Morjé Howard of the Institute of Peace told The Stage Media that the Liberia peacekeeping mission was considered successful because the UN implemented most parts of its mandate before departing. 

Numbers aside, the mission was not very different from other peacekeeping operations once Liberia decided it was in its best interest to cooperate with the UN mission, Alexandra Novosseloff of the International Peace Institute said.

“What worked in that process [was] that there was a high-level committee where the UN, the European Commission and major embassies were meeting to coordinate their policies, views and actions.”

In a September 2021 webinar for the Institut Barcelona D’Estudis Internacionals, a Spanish inter-university institute, Robert Blair said the Liberia mission had increased citizens’ reliance on state authorities and also exacerbated the perception of state corruption in the country.

He wrote the book Peacekeeping and the Rule of Law after the Civil War.

“The UN has positive and potentially lasting effects on the rule of law in war-torn countries like Liberia and the goal of a UN mission should not be transforming a country to look like Sweden but to improve the quality of lives and governance.” We have contacted Blair for more comments.

Conclusion: Other African UN peacekeeping missions are larger, but Liberia’s legacy still debated
In a debate on the radio, Liberian economist Samuel Jackson claimed the UN’s Liberia mission had been the largest in Africa, with 17,000 troops. 

But publicly available data shows there have been other UN missions on the continent with considerably more military personnel, including in Sudan and the DRC. At its height, the Liberia mission had 15,000 uniformed personnel. 

Both parts of the claim are therefore inaccurate. The legacy of the mission however continues to be avidly debated.

Explainer: Liberia’s political jigsaw and the proliferation of violence ,The Stage Media-Liberia,"Jackson Clay, Dubawa FellowWhat was meant to be a peaceful demonstration on Liberia’s 175th Independence Day celebration turned violent after a pro-government group, the Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC) Council of Patriots (COP),brutalized a student of the state-run campus-based political party,The Vanguard Student Unification Party (SUP).The incident occurred early on Tuesday, July 26, 2022, after the students decided to stage a protest before the United States Embassy in Monrovia. Among other things, the students asked the government tofix the country, a tagline that has become popular for many anti-government protesters.The violence is a drawback for the country’s fledgling democracy, something DUBAWA is concerned about and has taken an interest in understanding vis-a-vis causes of the violence, the groups associated with it, and what can be done to avoid such violence in the future.The Coalition and Patriots MarriageThe Coalition for Democratic Change Council of Patriots (CDC CoP) is a breakaway group from what used to be the Council of Patriots, an anti-government organization that was vehement in its opposition to the ruling government. Since breaking away and joining forces with the governing party, it has spared no effort backing all government projects and activities.The violence witnessed on July 26 appears to be a by-product of this new political marriage in which the breakaway members of the Council Patriots underlined their steadfast allegiance to the Coalition of Democratic Change. In the process, some members of The Vanguard Student Unification Party (SUP) became victims of the violent attacks.Demonstration and political violenceThe members of Vanguard Student Unification Party (SUP) were angry over what they said was the rising cost of living in Liberia, the rising state of insecurity, and a weak educational system.Food prices have soared, owing largely to hikes in gasoline, which is now selling at US$5.66 (L$875), up from US$5.00 (L$750). As a result,transportationfares have increased, thus triggering agitations by some commercial drivers, bike and tricycle (Kehkeh) riders, and other citizens in the country.There have also been a series of deaths in the country, raising questions about insecurity. In a recent conversation, it was so severe that the President charged Liberians toinstall CCTV for their protection. The Minister of State for Presidential Affairs, Nathaniel McGill, was also on record saying that the government is considering making the installation of CCTV mandatory in the country, as reported by the government-owned news outlet,The Liberia News Agency (LINA).These comments angered a section of the citizens, including members of the SUP. They were also not happy with the results of Liberian students in the WASSCE exams, even though the Weah administration shouldered the cost of taking the West African Senior School Certificate Examinations (WASSCE) for all senior students in the country.For these reasons and many others, the protestors first hit the streets on July 26, first to the US Embassy in Liberia to hand over their petition.Why the US Embassy?Per Article 41 of the Vienna Convention, Heads of Missions have a duty not to interfere with the internal activities of a host country. However, in Liberia, the angry protesters say they had lost confidence in the Weah-led administration so much that they did not even trust him to listen to their grievances. Instead, they believed the US Embassy could engage the Weah administration better, hence their decision to petition the US Embassy.On the day of the demonstration, the students who had decided to converge on campus before making their way to the US Embassy in Monrovia changed their plan by moving straight to the Embassy.At the US Embassy, located at the top of Benson Street in central Monrovia, the students waved placards with inscriptions “fix the country” while chanting anti-government slogans. This did not go well with the Coalition of Democratic Change Council of Patriots (CDC CoP), who embarked on a counter-protest.Checks by DUBAWA indicate that as early as 6:00 am that fateful Tuesday morning, the CDC-CoP, besieged the headquarters of the campus-based political party,SUP, on the Capitol Hill campus of the University of Liberia, hoping to find the students there. Seeing nobody, the CDC-CoP members moved to the US Embassy wearing white t-shirts with thewords, “George Weah is fixing the country.There was chaos shortly after, with the pro-government supporters chasing and pelting the anti-government supporters with stones. This would later turn bloody with injuries to several students, one of them critical. The victim, Christopher Walter Sisulu Sivili, was brutalized in the full glare of the camera. He was hospitalized in Liberia for some days but has since beenflown out of the country to seek medical attention.This attack has received widespread condemnation by multiple stakeholders in Liberia.The Minister of Justice, Musa F Dean, has condemned the violent acts. He did not receive any request from any group for a demonstration, as required by law. Per Liberia’s Public Order Law which isthe National Police Act 2015 Section III Article 22.86,persons who wish to embark on any demonstration must first petition the Minister of Justice.He has since directed theInspector General of Police to investigate the attacks.The lawsuit against aggressors?Even before the IGP began investigations into the matter, the Council of Patriots (CoP) had sworn to take legal action against the group that attacked the SUP.Joseph Vallai, COP Secretary GeneralThe Secretary General of the group, Joseph K. Vallai, disclosed that the organization would institute a 1.5million lawsuit against the abusers of the victim to ensure that he gets justice.“What happened on July 26 of this year was a complete crackdown on civil liberty and abuse of human rights in public square and this cannot be a CDC-CoP thing, because was an attack on post war Liberia’s democracy,” he noted.Explaining why some members broke away from the group, Mr. Vallai stated the aggrieved persons were suspended for acts of insubordination. For that reason, they decided to join the governing party.He said the Council of Patriots was established to hold the Weah administration accountable to the people and will need committed members to do that.Since its formation in 2019, the group has had a series of protests in the country, including the famousJune 7, 2019 protestunder the theme: “Save the State.” It is regarded as Liberia’s biggest post-war protest.Student Unification Party (SUP)Members of the SUPDUBAWA contacted the General Secretary of the Student Unification Party (SUP), Jusu Kamara, to find out his thoughts about the demonstration and the attacks.“We were calling on the George Weah administration to fix the educational sector of this country and the kangaroo justice system. We were also calling on him to act on the Liberia Anti-Corruption Commission (LACC)reports which fingered several government officials and institutions, including the Liberia Water and Sewer Corporation (LWSC) the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) and the Liberia Institute for Statistics and Geo-Information Services (LISGIS) for acts of corruption,” he stated.Kamara condemned the attack on the students during their demonstration. Meanwhile, the campus-based political party has vowed to come out in their numbers to stage another protest until the George Weah-led government listens to their calls.Coalition of Democratic Change (CDC) Council of Patriots (CoP)On their part, though, members of the Coalition for Democratic Change have dismissed the allegations of violence against them. According to the group’s chairman, Ben Believe Togbah Jnr, they did not organize any violent protest as was reported. Speaking on OKAY FM, which was transmitted live on the station’s officialFacebook Page, Mr. Togbah Jnr denied accusations of counter-demonstration and violent attacks on the SUP.Members of the CDC-CoPAccording to him, they had gone to show gratitude to President Weah for the many developmental initiatives undertaken since becoming President. Still, they encountered hostile members of the Student Unification Party (SUP), some of whom were throwing rocks and wielding deadly weapons, an allegation that DUBAWA cannot independently verify.What does Civil Society think About Demonstrations?The Executive Director of the Center For Media Studies & Peace Building (CEMESP), Malcolm W. Joseph, has condemned the violent demonstrations. He told DUBAWA thatArticle 17 of the Liberian constitutionspells out the right for every Liberian to assemble at all times freely but in an orderly manner.He is convinced that notifying the government before a demonstration is necessary to ensure the safety of the demonstrators but was quick to throw in a word of caution.“Notifying the government does not mean that the government will have to be selective in who demonstrates or who doesn’t. Sometimes when the government of the day realizes that those who want to protest or demonstrate are critical of the government, the government may not want to grant them the permission to do so,” he statedDubawa published this story.Related ",02/10/2022,https://tsmliberia.com/explainer-liberias-political-jigsaw-and-the-proliferation-of-violence/,1

"Dual citizens cannot be elected as Representatives, Senators despite new law",Bettie Johnson-Mbayo,"by Jackson Clay, Dubawa FellowClaim: Persons with Dual Citizenship under the new dual citizenship law of Liberia are allowed to contest for Representatives and Senators.Nowhere in the new law does it allow dual citizens to be elected as Representatives, and Senators.Full TextLiberia was founded by freed US slaves in 1847 as “a refuge and a haven for freed men of colour”. Its constitution defines black people in the language of the time, as “persons who are Negroes or of Negro descent”.For years, the issue of dual citizenship in Liberia has been a very critical topic in the country since its post-war era. This is so because, during the country’s over fourteen years of civil unrest, many Liberians fled the country for safety in other countries, particularly in Europe and the Americas and took up those countries’ citizenship for diverse reasons.The old alien and Nationality law states “A child who is a Liberia citizen by virtue of the provisions of subparagraph (b) of this section shall lose his citizenship unless he has resided in Liberia before attaining his majority or unless when he attains his majority and before attaining the age of 23 he goes before a Liberian consul and takes the oath of allegiance to the Republic of Liberia required of a petitioner for naturalization.”This law states further “(a)A person who is a Negro, or of Negro descent, born in Liberia and subject to the jurisdiction thereof. (b) A person born outside Liberia whose father (i) was born a citizen of Liberia; (ii) was a citizen of Liberia at the time of the birth of such child, and (iii) had resided in Liberia prior to the birth of such child.”Upon taking over as President of Liberia in 2018, President George Manneh Weah asserted during his first State of the Nation Address (SONA) that the Liberian constitution was racist, unnecessary and inappropriate and promised to scrap the law that prohibits foreigners from becoming citizens of the country.His position was further strengthened by a landmark case in 2019 whenthe Liberian Supreme Court ruled that citizenship is a right that could not be revoked without a trial.However, it is believed that some Liberians, especially the privileged, secretly carry dual passports.Notwithstanding how crucial this case was, it did not automatically grant Liberians a right to be dual citizens.There was a continued push for the new law on dual citizens with Liberians in the diaspora playing a huge role. After years of controversy including areferendum to reject the Dual Citizens law in December 2020,the country has finally agreed to a newDual Citizens law passed in 2022.There is, however, some simmering controversy over the rights to be accorded the dual citizens of Liberia.During a radio talk show aired on a local radio station, Okay 99.5FM, Wednesday, August 10, 2022, Montserrado County District #16 Representative Dixon Seboe claimed that under the new amended alien and nationality law of Liberia, persons with dual citizenship are allowed to contest for Representatives and senators but cannot be speaker of the House of Representatives and President Pro-Tempore of the Liberian Senate.The claim was made in the14 minute of the show and was carried live on the station’s Facebook pagewith over two thousand viewers andmore than one hundred and fifty comments. This show is one of the most widely listened to shows in the country.VerificationGiven how controversial this case has been over decades and the premium attention it has garnered owing to the amendment of the law, DUBAWA decided to investigate the claim made by Representative Dixon Seboe.This Fact Checker combed through the provisions of the old law which the amendment sought to change. The old laws includePart III, Chapter 20, Section 20.1; Chapter 21, Sections 21.30, 21.31, 21.51 & 21.52 and Chapter 22, Sections 22.1, 22.1 & 22.4 of the Aliens and Nationality Law of the Liberian Code of Law Revised, Vol. II.DUBAWA then went further to look at the new amendment passed by Parliament to ascertain if the claim by the Representative was true.Part of the new amendment can be accessed in thisnews reportwith the relevant portions of the new law quoted as follows;“A Liberian citizen who holds citizenship for another country shall not be eligible for any elective public office while still a citizen of another country,” the legislature said in the repeal of the Aliens and Nationality Law.“If such a person desires to contest, the person must renounce the citizenship of the other country at least one year before applying to the National Elections Commission (NEC) to contest with documentary evidence of such renunciation from the country and filed with a circuit court in Liberia.”“Also, a Liberian citizen who holds the citizenship of another country must not be eligible for appointment to the public offices of Minister of Finance and Development Planning; Minister of Defense, and Executive Governor of the Central Bank of Liberia.”As can be seen, the amended law prohibits those with dual citizenship from occupying an elected office and from becoming Minister of Defense, Governor of the Central Bank of Liberia and Minister of Finance in the country.The new law has received massive media reviews and reportage as can be seenhereandhere.ConclusionChecks by DUBAWA into the amended law do not support the claim made by Representative Dixon Seboe. While the amended law grants Liberians power to hold dual citizenship it does not allow dual citizens to occupy elected office and other sensitive positions.Related ",29/08/2022,https://tsmliberia.com/dual-citizens-cannot-be-elected-as-representatives-senators-despite-new-law/,0
Fact Check: The Central Bank of Liberia has not minted coins...,Bettie Johnson-Mbayo,"Claim: “The government through the Central Bank of (CBL) has minted coins in the L$25 and L$30 denominations,” according to a Facebook user.
Verdict: The Central Bank of Liberia says it only minting coins in L$5 and L$10 denominations.

Full Text
Liberia seems to be returning to the pre-war era where Liberians used coins for business transactions and as legal tender. In 1847 and 1862, copper 1 and 2 cents coins were issued and were the only Liberian coins until 1896, when a full coinage consisting of 1, 2, 10, 25 and 50 cents coins were introduced. The last issues were made in 1906.

In accordance with Article 34(d) of the Liberian constitution, the Liberian legislature mandated the Central Bank of Liberia to print new currency and mint coins in the country.

Article 34(d) states that the legislature shall have the power, among other things, “to levy taxes, duties, imports, exercise and other revenues, to borrow money, issue currency, mint coins, and to make appropriations for the fiscal governance of the Republic.” 

It is upon this reliance, the Liberian legislature, on May 6, 2021, signed and issued a joint resolution (Resolution #001/2021) authorizing the Central Bank of Liberia to print and mint the new family of Liberian currency to the tone of L$48 billion 

The legislature’s decision was informed by the Counsel from the Economic Management Team (EMT) of the country falling shortages of Liberian dollar notes on the market. There is also a huge quantity of mutilated banknotes and the scarcity of smaller denominations like L$5, L$10 and L$20 Liberian banknotes on the market. 

This new currency is expected to be printed and minted within a three-year period beginning in 2021, 2022 and 2024. The year  2023 was skipped because, according to the legislature, it is the election year.

There have been occasions where taxi drivers, tricycles (kehkeh), and motorbike riders and passengers get into confrontations over lack of change or when there is disagreement over mutilated currency as change or transport fares.   

It is to solve these challenges that the Liberia Legislature in March of 2021, granted authorization to the CBL for the printing and minting of new family of Liberian currency. 

Following the authorization, the CBL, in December of 2021 printed and brought into the country the first consignment of newly printed Liberian dollar banknotes so as to help ease the problems during the festive season CBL. 

Despite the coming of the first batch of the newly printed Liberian dollars in the country, the problem of shortages of smaller denominations and mutilated money still persisted because the CBL had only printed notes in higher denominations, including one hundred Liberian dollars here CBL.

Despite the chronology of the events, there has been news of the arrival of the new family of banknotes and minted coins in the country with some Liberians taking to their social media (Facebook) pages with claims of what they believe is the image of the newly minted coins. 


Among the many posts on social media (Facebook) was  Liberia’s famous social media giant based in Canada, Varney A Teah who goes by the Facebook name “Strong Gbana Pekin.” 

This post by Strong Gbana Pekin generated over 250 comments, 13 shares and over 270 emojis.

Verification
Due to the seriousness of the currency situation in the country, DUBAWA embarked on an investigative venture to ascertain the facts surrounding the various posts flooding social media (Facebook) in recent times as can be seen here and here.

DUBAWA first decided to look at the authorization granted the CBL to print banknotes and mint coins, by the Liberian Legislature “Resolution #001/2021” and resolution is found on page 18 and 19 of the CBL annual report 2021.

DUBAWA went further by contacting one of the officials at the CBL Atty. Alphonso Zeon to provide explanation for the various claims on Facebook about the new 30 Liberian dollars and 25 Liberian dollars minted coins.

Mr. Alponson Zeon insisted there were no 30 or 25 Liberian dollar minted coins as can be seen in the WhatsApp conversation below. 


DUBAWA also contacted the Head of Communication at the CBL, Mr. Cyrus Wleh Badio, who told us that the various claims on Facebook are false.

Mr. Cyrus Wleh Badio indicated that the news trending on Facebook about the bank minting 25 and 30 Liberian dollars coins are fabricated and far from the truth as can be seen again in the WhatsApp conversation below.


A release has, however, been issued by the Ministry of Information Cultural Affairs & Tourism (MICAT) clarifying the numerous Facebook posts. 


This statement was also published on the government-run media outlet, The New Liber Newspaper as well as on Liberia Ministry of Information Facebook page.

Conclusion
Investigation by DUBAWA into social media (Facebook) posts suggests that speculations that the CBL has minted L$25 and L$30 coins are false. The CBL has clarified that it has only minted L$5 and L$10 in coins contrary to the many Facebook posts.

Fact Check: Nathaniel McGill Does Not Have Account with UBA Ghana,Bettie Johnson-Mbayo,"Claim: UBA Ghana Reportedly Blocked Nathaniel McGill’s $4M Account

Verdict: False

Full Text: Global News Network, Thursday, August 18, reported that Suspended Minister of State for Presidential Affairs Nathaniel McGill’s account at United Bank for Africa (UBA) in Accra, Ghana, containing over Four Million United States Dollars, has been blocked based on instructions from the sanctions committee.

The story attracted many social media users, including KMTV, an online media outlet, and blogs: All Factz, and  The Liberian Influence.

Monday, August 15, 2022, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced that it had designated three Liberian government officials, Nathaniel McGill, Sayma Syrenius Cephus, and Bill Twehway, for their involvement in ongoing public corruption in Liberia.

According to the notice, these officials were designated under Executive Order (E.O.) 13818, which builds upon and implements the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act and targets perpetrators of severe human rights abuse and corruption around the world.

“Through their corruption, these officials have undermined democracy in Liberia for their own personal benefit,” said Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian E. Nelson. “Treasury’s designations today demonstrate that the United States remains committed to holding corrupt actors accountable and to the continued support of the Liberian people,” the Department said.

The U.S. government is accusing McGill of bribing business owners, receiving bribes from potential investors, and accepting kickbacks for steering contracts to companies in which he is interested.

He is also said to have manipulated public procurement processes to award multi-million dollar contracts to companies in which he has ownership, including by abusing emergency procurement processes to rig contract bids.

“McGill is credibly accused of involvement in a wide range of other corrupt schemes including soliciting bribes from government office seekers and misappropriating government assets for his gain. He has used government funds allocated to other Liberian government institutions to run his projects, made off-the-books payments in cash to senior government leaders, and organized warlords to threaten political rivals. 

McGill has received an unjustified stipend from various Liberian government institutions and used his position to prevent his misappropriation from being discovered. McGill regularly distributes thousands of dollars in undocumented cash to other government officials for government and non-government activities.

McGill is being designated for being a foreign person who is a current government official who is responsible for or complicit in, or who has directly or indirectly engaged in, corruption, including the misappropriation of state assets, the expropriation of private assets for personal gain, corruption related to government contracts or the extraction of natural resources, or bribery,” the U.S. authorities said.

The U.S. authorities have therefore ordered that all property and interests in property of these politicians that are in the United States or the possession or control of U.S. persons must be blocked and reported to OFAC.

Verification: The Stage Media contacted UBA Ghana through its Facebook page, and the bank said, “Please be informed that we do not have an account in UBA Ghana in the name of Nathaniel  McGill. Therefore, we can’t block a statement we do not have. The reports are false and should be disregarded.

We also used ScamDoc to verify the Facebook Page of the bank, which analysis resulted in a 99 percent trusted source.

Ghana Business News also reported that “UBA Ghana says there’s no $4m account in the name of a Liberian government official on U.S. sanctions list.”

In the article, the Ghana news outlet said Henry Nii Dottey, Head, Marketing & Corporate Communications of the bank, in an inquiry on the claim, said on August 19, 2022, that the bank has no account in the name of McGill.

Furthermore, McGill told FrontPage Africa that he does not have Foreign accounts.

“I am one official of the government who does not have any foreign bank account. GAC or whoever can audit me, I don’t have any foreign account, and neither am I a signatory to the Ministry of State’s account. I don’t take government money,” Min. McGill told FPA.

Conclusion: With UBA Ghana verifying the claim, it is safe to say that the story reported by Global News Network is False.

"No, Ghana has not Introduced uniforms for Teachers, But,",The Stage Media-Liberia,"Claim: Ghana Introduces school uniforms for teachersSource: The Liberian Influence
Verdict: The Ghana Education Service (GES) denied reports of introducing new uniforms for teachers in public schools, and says the social media circular is FAKE, but, it was an initiative by a group of teachers.
Full Text: The Liberian Influence, a popular blog in Liberia posted on its social media page that Ghana introduces school uniforms for teachers.

The blog requested comments on if Liberia should do the same?

“Ghana introduces school uniforms for teachers. Should Liberia do the same?”

The social media post on Wednesday, April 13, attracted 73 comments, 140 reactions, and 3 shares. 

Verification: A Reverse Image search showed that the story was previously reported by Opera News but the article was debunked by the Ghana Education Service on April 10.

GES’s Facebook page posted “DISCLAIMER, GES is one of the largest Gov’t agencies in Ghana. We employ more than half of all Gov’t employees. If we want to introduce uniforms for teachers, we won’t do that through social media and over the weekend. In this era of unionized labor, GES cannot introduce a uniform for teachers without engaging the teacher unions. DISREGARD THIS FAKE NEWS.

Though many see the post as a government own to provide teachers with uniforms the story is relative to teachers who believed the initiative was nice and threw their support behind their idea.

It has rather turned out that, the initiative was a self-initiated one by a section of teachers in the Ahafo Ano North District.

Teachers of Tepa Methodist Basic School and Akwasiase Methodist Primary School, all in the Ahafo Ano North District initiated the teacher uniform project.

"SONA22 Fact Check: No, Atlantic Corporation is not the first to...",The Stage Media-Liberia,"Pic Credit: All Africa Claim: “In 2021, the Atlantic Cocoa Corporation exported the first containers of certified organic cocoa from Liberia.”Source: President George Manneh WeahVerdict: FalseFull Text: President George Manneh Weah in the State of the Nation Address (SONA) claimed that the Atlantic Cocoa Corporation exported for the first time in Liberia containers of certified organic cocoa from Liberia.“ While Liberia’s cocoa production lags behind production giants in the region, Liberian cocoa continues to win awards and prizes in international competitions for its exceptional quality. My administration is therefore promoting and working to provide the enabling environment for high-quality production of cash and food crops.Verification: In Liberia, cocoa is an important cash crop whose export potential remains dormant as a result of 14 years of civil conflict that plagued the country from 1989 to 2003 and the slow, albeit growing, support the sector has received since the end of the conflict.The cocoa output that stood at 10,000 tons per year in the 1970s dropped to near-zero levels for the duration of the conflict.A Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) survey published in 2002 noted that the number of cocoa farms operating in 2001 had dropped to 38% of the pre-war level (1988), indicating the widespread impact.On the side of the market, Liberia faces an uphill battle as it seeks to position itself with strong regional competitors such as Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana, the former with a global reputation for supply capacity and consistency and the latter with a worldwide reputation for supplying high-quality cocoa.There is significant progress to be made in terms of building a global brand for Liberian cocoa that not only builds upon high levels of supply consistency and quality but is also identified through a brand of its own in international target markets.The Stage Media in verifying the claims reached out to Sheikh Turay, CEO of Liberation Cocoa, who did not agree with the information.He said exporting organic cocoa is the new trend for cocoa dealers adding that in time past, exports were just cocoa beans.He named African Venture Liberia as the institution that exported cocoa in 2018.Also, a former employee Siehdi, of the companypostedon her social media page on January 24 that the claim was untrue.“The FIRST CONTAINERS OF CERTIFIED COCOA amounting to 82 tons exported from Liberia in 2018 was being sold by Africa Ventures Limited (AVL) owned by Mr. George Howard who was a beneficiary of a project.”“I worked on as an Intervention Manager. I spent months, weeks, days on the roads from Monrovia to Buu-Yao District, Nimba County. I can name every town that was part of that success story.LACRA and MOA have that information and I do too. Atlantic is not the first to export certified cocoa. #SONAAccording to her, the African Venture Liberia was been certified by UTZ nowRainforest Alliance.Additionally,  the Liberia National Cocoa Strategy 2014-2018 states that the figures of sustainable production stand in stark contrast to the overall supply of conventional cocoa on the global market, of which 70% is produced in AfricaBoth Rainforest Alliance and organic cocoa have driven this trend with 76.2% and 75.7%, respectively, of their total supply provided by Latin America.It furthers that Fairtrade represents the exception to this rule, being predominantly supplied by African producers.The trend for sourcing is likely to change, not only as the field for certified cocoa is fairly new, but also as West African producers start to certify their production. Organic cocoa is the only sustainable cocoa with sourcing (4.9%) from Asia.Meanwhile, TSM  contacted Gordon Garway, Communication Director, Liberia Agriculture Commodity Regulatory Authority (LACRA).According to him, the information was given included in SONA22 because the entity recorded current events under the institution.“We do not have a record of what occurred before the establishment of LACRA, so we recorded what exactly occurred since we started operation.”LACRA was established to replace the Liberian Produce Marketing Corporation (LPMC) as defined in Chapter 57 of the Executive Law of 1973 for promoting the production, processing and marketing of high-quality agricultural commodities particularly cocoa, coffee, palm other agricultural produce.The entity is to ensure the provision of a well-regulated market for cocoa, coffee, palm and other agricultural products for fair competition among all actors in the value chain; facilitate standardization of quality of agricultural commodities including cocoa, coffee, palm etc.Conclusion: President Weah’s claim that ACC is the first to export organic cocoa is False; moreover, LACRA replaced LPMC; therefore, the SONA22 on Cocoa export is incorrect.Related ",27/01/2022,https://tsmliberia.com/sona22-fact-check-no-atlantic-corporation-is-not-the-first-to-export-organic-cocoa/,0
Fact Check: Did President Weah get his facts on Education in...,The Stage Media-Liberia,"As President George addresses the nation on Monday, January 24, we fact-check hisclaim that the University of Liberia enrollment has increased from 8,000-18,000 students.There is an ongoing free- tuition policy for state-owned universities andcolleges.“We are encouraged by the impact of our free tuition policy for state-owned universities and colleges.For example, since the implementation of this policy, we have seen enrolment at the University of Liberia more than doubled, from 8,000 students to 18,000 students. “At the same time, Minister of State for Presidential Affairs Nathaniel McGill has made a similar claim.“The University of Liberia enrollment during the past administration was 6-8000 but Since we took office the current enrollment is 18-19,000.”The Stage Media requested the administration of the University of Liberia through the Freedom of Information (FOI) to provide the enrollment details.Our request generated information from the 2014 enrollment to the 2020/2021 first semester.In 2014/15, the University of Liberia enrollment was 32,625 with males comprising 70 percentwhile females amounted to 30 percent.After the declaration of the policy in 2018 there was a massive climb in enrollment at the University of Liberia with the registration of 38,391While the 2019/ 20 and 2020/21 first semester records were the lowest, it is safe to say excluding 2018/19, the University enrollment has been above 18,000 before the ascendency of the Weah’s-led administration.See the table belowRelated ",24/01/2022,https://tsmliberia.com/fact-check-did-president-weah-get-his-facts-on-education-in-2021-sona/,1

What to know about the Lofa Road,The Stage Media-Liberia,"The pavement of Lofa road has brought forth claims and counterclaims between current officials of Government and Sirleaf’s fanatic.The former Information Minister and now Maritime Commissioner, Eugene Nagbe appeared on OK FM (2: 43min) conversation, Wednesday, December 29 claimed that though there were commitments by the previous administration on the construction of the road, there was little or nothing done to begin the construction.According to Nagbe, there was a contract signed from Gbarnga to Salayea and now it is Gbarnga to Mendekoma.“It is a big lie! There was no money available for the Gbarnga – Konia Road before President Weah took over. We have to push and push and push to have this Lofa Road going so how can somebody say that money was there?”Nagbe continues, “ If it was there why they did not fix the road?  There was a contract signed from Gbarnga to Salayea  now it is Gbarnga to Mendekoma.”The maritime commissioner stated that on January 17, 2020, the President‘s Annual message was named the Lofa Road.“ It is the ‘Loan agreement for the upgrading Konia to Voinjama Road Project Between the Government of Liberian and the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development; it was passed by the legislature during the same year, “Nagbe’s.The statement was supported by Finance Minister Samuel Tweah when he phoned in.The Stage Media will analyze the claim in several parts.Was there an agreement between the Kuwait Fund and the Republic of Liberia prior to the current Administration?Yes, there was a Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development delegation that arrived in Monrovia on November 18, 2013 that met with the former President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and the Minister of Public Works.What Happened next?The discussion with the Kuwait Fund focused on the allocation of US$1.8 million provided to the government for the feasibility study for the Gbarnga-Mendekoma Highway, and on funding opportunities for the construction of that highway relative to the completion of the feasibility studies originally for Lots 1 and 2.Minister Antoinette Weeks provided an update of the completion of the feasibility studies for Lot 1 (Gbarnga to Konia) and Lot 2 (Konia to Mendekoma), citing the delay in delivering the documents for the latter, which are being prepared by a Kuwaiti consultant firm.According to the Minister, the initial estimated projected cost for the entire corridor was US$350-385 million.Response to Liberia by the KuwaitisThe representatives of the Fund acknowledged the internal problems with the consultant on Lot 2 and suggested that the government consider exploring other lenders, and suggested that Public Works should present two separate loan packages.The Fund recommended that Public Works prepare an executive summary for the construction of the Gbarnga-Mendekoma Highway to include the estimated project cost, economic benefits; and to indicate its financing options; on the percentage of the national budget versus external financing.Was there an agreement for Gbarnga to Salayea Road?Yes, there was an agreement between the Government of Liberia and the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic in 2016 that signed a $17 million United States Dollars loan agreement to help finance the Gbarnga –Salayea Road project. The road connects Bong and Lofa Counties.Was LOFA road included in the 2020 Annual Message?Yes, it was included four times in President George Weah Annual 2020 speech.It is safe to say that the Sirleaf administration secured monies as stated by Nedhal A. Alolayan, Deputy Director-General for Finance and Administration of Kuwaiti Fund for Arab Economic Development when he signed the 20M agreement in 2019.The loan according to Mr. Alolayan is the 4th concessionary loan extended to Liberia with a total amount of US$ 60 million, all of which are for the projects in the transport sector.However, he said the Fund has extended technical assistance amounting to about 1.8 million US Dollars for the preparation of the feasibility study and design of the Gbarnga-Mendekoma Road Project and a grant extended by the Government of the State of Kuwait to Liberia on March 2, 2012.Records from the Ministry of Finance show that there was a negotiation during Sirleaf’s Administration in 2017.

The Stage Media’s 2021: A Year in Review,The Stage Media-Liberia,"As 2022 draws closer, The Stage Media (TSM) is reflecting on some of the top feats achieved this year and when we recount, it won’t be overselling to say it has been a lot but with challenges.

in 2022 TSM will be entering its second year in August since it was established in 2020 when the Covid- 19 pandemic hit with a surge of cases in Liberia.

Despite the surge in cases, we have achieved major milestones and thanks to a dedicated and committed team, and  donors.

When TSM was founded, our aim has been tacklin misinformation and disinformation in Liberia and as the first Fact-checking media outlet, we gradually involved human interest stories, data analysis and investigative stories etc.

If you have time, read some of our amazing works on fact checking stories; the National Investment commission claim on investments growth and when the Liberia Petroleum for Refining Corporation building was dedicated, we fact-checked a claim that it was the first Administrative construction

President Weah in his Annual Message was also fact-checked and we found out there was a claim of exaggeration; understatement and misinformation.

When the National Transport Authority Driver was hit, there was a claim that he was shot.

A few moments for TSM in 2021, was when Premium Times and Africa Check trained Liberian Journalists in fact-checking, through a partnership.

Did you also read our explainer on the invincible park; and a motorcyclist who was wounded by acid but could not complete the treatment because of the increased bill.

During the height of Covid-19, facemasks made locally helped citizens combat coronavirus and despite the surge, Journalists in Liberia also explained their economic woes including old folks, market women and persons with disability.

Electricity remains a major problem in Liberia, and in Brewerville, a project that was to be completed in two years is yet to be ended.

A Jealous Rage also revealed how President George Weah’s claim as a Feminist in Chief remains vague.

Do you know that we used the FOI to ascertain Senator’s assets and it was established that they escaped accounting for their wealth?

When we first established TSM, another major investigation was on the pollution of four communities by Cemenco, watch the full documentary here.

How we change the Reporting Narrative

Verifying information as a journalist is one of the responsibilities whether the claim was made by a politician, journalist or a public figure. Our platform has depth in an investigative documentary, data journalism which is in the public interest. At the same time, ensuring that journalists in Liberia engage in fact-checks, data journalism.

Donor Support

You may know that media organizations have faced great financial difficulty due to the Covid-19 pandemic. This is why support from donors who believe in your mandate and provide financial support must be acknowledged and appreciated, for, without them, many would have gone under including TSM.

TSM’s story of survival through the height of the pandemic last year and subsequent successes in 2021 is, for instance, not complete without a mention of the aid provided by Premium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism.

We collaborated with Dataphyte Nigeria and the Press Union of Liberia in 2021.

The Global Investigative Journalism Network (Africa) additionally has provided technical support to the work of TSM.

We would like to say that the past year has shown that partnering with development organizations can set a pace for a new media institution like us in achieving institutional goals.

Readership Growth

TSM report this 2021 was read and thanks to social media who have helped in circulating our stories far and wide.

Our readership has been fluctuating due to the Covid-19 and we would like to say that since Fact-check and data Journalism is apparently new to Liberia, it may take time to peak.

Team Internal Progress

When we were established in 2020, it was a very rocky start, we were only three and despite during Covid-19 surge, we continue to tackle misinformation and disinformation around the pandemic to help build public confidence in Covid-19 information.

We can say despite little or no funding when we started until being rescued by PTCIJ, our team grew to seven and there were major hurdles, but our team remains steadfast and endured to date.

As one of the partners may say, this is a learning curve for TSM and there are structural gaps with our hope that in 2022 these gaps are addressed, and team members learned from experiences whether good or bad.

As we move to 2022, we expect a huge stage to be set for journalism in Liberia, in ensuring that more investigations are done to hold the powerful accountable and to have a more hands-on approach that will boost the efficiency and productivity of journalism in Liberia.",30/12/2021,https://tsmliberia.com/the-stage-medias-2021-a-year-in-review/,1

What you need to know about the Two- brands of Covid-19...,The Stage Media-Liberia,"In March 2021, Liberia received  96,000  COVID-19 dosages vaccine shipped via the COVAX initiative, a partnership between CEPI, Gavi, UNICEF and WHO.

The arrival of the vaccines in Liberia is part of the historic step towards achieving the goal of equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines globally, in what will be the largest vaccine procurement and supply operation in history.

This delivery was part of the first wave of shipments that will continue to different countries in the coming days and weeks.

So far, the Liberian government says it has given out 880 Doses and 14.9 are fully vaccinated since it kicked off its nationwide vaccination programme.

Recently, the government also received the second Shipment of 96,000 doses of AstraZeneca Vaccine donated by the French Government.

On August 2021 and was received by Minister of Health, Wilhemina Jallah and the US Ambassador, UNICEF officials on behalf of Liberia at the Roberts International Airport. This was followed by additional 302,400 doses of COVID-19 vaccines donated by the United States of America to help the country battle the third wave of infections

What did the Ministry of Health say?
The MOH said the contribution from the French government gives additional strength to Liberia’s fight against COVID-19. 

Together with the full new batch, the overall amount of the vaccines received through COVAX reached 494,400 doses as 96,000 doses of AstraZeneca vaccine and 302,400 doses of Johnson and Johnson were received earlier. 

What are the 2 brands of vaccines? 
Oxford-Astrazeneca vaccine 
The Oxford-Astrazeneca vaccine is a viral vector vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca, a pharmaceutical company and given by intramuscular injection. According to Medical News Today, the viral vector vaccine contains the gene that encodes for the spike protein on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and once delivered to the cells, the gene is transcribed, prompting our cells to make the spike protein.

It is the presence of the protein that triggers the body’s immune system to produce antibodies to fight against the spike protein, which prepares the body to fight against Covid-19 should it enter the body. The vaccine has a shelf life of six months stored in a refrigerator between 2 to 8°C and once removed from the fridge, maybe stored between 2 to 25°C for up to six hours. 

Johnson and Johnson vaccine
Johnson and Johnson’s vaccine is the second vaccine to be granted emergency use authorization by the US Food and Drugs Administration after Pfizer and Moderna. Unlike Pfizer and Moderna however, the Johnson and Johnson, like Oxford-Astrazeneca are viral vector vaccines that use a modified, harmless version of a different virus as a vector, or carrier, to deliver immunity instructions to cells in the body. The body then follows those instructions to build an immune response to the intended virus (in this case, SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19.)

Between Oxford-AstraZeneca, and Johnson and Johnson
There are few differences between the J & J and AstraZeneca which are the two vaccines that have been deployed to Liberia. All two have been granted emergency use authorization by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as well as approved for use in Liberia by the Ministry of Health.

Oxford-AstraZeneca was the first vaccine to be administered in Liberia and according to a report by the BBC, it is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus (known as an adenovirus) from chimpanzees and has been modified to contain genetic material shared by the coronavirus – although it can’t cause the illness.

 The Johnson & Johnson vaccine requires storage at 35.6 to 46.4 degrees F. According to the company, the vaccine is estimated to remain stable for two years at -4°F (-20°C) and a maximum of three months at routine refrigeration at temperatures of 36-46°F (2 to 8°C).

Speaking on the vaccine, Minister Jallah said the AstraZeneca vaccine from the French government gives additional strength to Liberia’s fight against COVID-19.  

 “All the vaccines received by the government – (AstraZeneca and Janssen’s Johnson and Johnson) are safe therefore, all who are yet to receive the vaccine should do so” Dr. Jallah added.

Together with the full new batch, the overall amount of the vaccines received through COVAX reached 494,400 doses as 96,000 doses of AstraZeneca vaccine and 302,400 doses of Johnson and Johnson were received earlier.

COVAX is co-led by GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), working in partnership with UNICEF as well as the World Bank, civil society organizations, manufacturers, and others.

The Janssen Vaccines was developed in Leiden, Netherlands, and its Belgian parent company Janssen Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of American company Johnson & Johnson.

It is a viral vector vaccine based on a human adenovirus that has been modified to contain the gene for making the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. The body’s immune system responds to this spike protein to produce antibodies. The vaccine requires only one dose and does not need to be stored frozen.

Clinical trials for the vaccine were started in June 2020, with Phase III trials involving around 43,000 people. On 29 January 2021, Janssen announced that 28 days after a completed vaccination, the vaccine was 66% effective in a one-dose regimen in preventing symptomatic COVID-19, with an 85% efficacy in preventing severe COVID-19, and 100% efficacy in preventing hospitalization or death caused by the disease.

The vaccine has been granted by the US Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency (EMA and the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency.

 What Liberian Expert Says 

Though there are concerns over the different brands of Covid-19 vaccines imported into the country, Liberia health experts have dispelled fears over the two brands, stating the two vaccines are approved.

 Dr. Dougbeh Nyan assured Liberians that the COVID-19 vaccines, regardless of brand, as long as they have been approved by WHO, provide adequate protection against the disease.

Dr. Nyan said, “Yes, the people should take the COVID-19 vaccines. I have consistently advised citizens to take any of the COVID-19 vaccines that are available in Liberia and the rest of Africa because this will protect lives and keep the virus from being transmitted to other people. 

“And, once we can stop (by vaccination) the virus from being transmitted, then we would have succeeded in preventing the virus from changing portion of its genes (what we called “mutation”).”

Dr. Nyan furthers that these mutations are the cause of the variants such as the highly infectious Delta variant of COVID-19 that is responsible for the 3rd wave of infections seen in Liberia and the world. 

“Besides, I will continue to advise citizens to wear their masks, sanitize or wash their hands, and continue to avoid gathering in large crowds. Always follow what I termed as the Four Commandments of COVID-19 Prevention. 

“That is, Thou Shall Take Your COVID-19 Vaccine, Thou Shall Wear Your Mask; Thou Shall Wash and Sanitize Your Hands; and, Thou Shall Keep Your Distance. Importantly, the government needs to continue the Community and Public Vaccination Awareness Campaign initiated by my team in April and May of 2021.”

He encouraged parents to have their eligible children vaccinated once the vaccine becomes available. 

Dr. Jallah at the Ministry of Information’s regular press briefing on Thursday, July 29, 2021, said that those who are having weddings, church services and other gatherings should abide by the health protocols that were instituted by the Incident Management System (IMS).

“We are seeing good news in the Covid-19 fight. Two days in the roll, we had no positive case,” Dr. Jallah disclosed.

She added: “We are begging you, we want this thing to finish. Our recovery rate is very good. All of this good news I’m telling you does not mean you must put down your masks. We want you to wear it always.”",20/12/2021,https://tsmliberia.com/1835-2/,1
Was the Transit Authority Driver Shot?,The Stage Media-Liberia,"Screenshot of Martin Kollie' postClaim: The Liberia National Police has confirmed the shooting of a National Transit Authority Bus driver.Source: Martin Kollie, social activistVerdict: False, Medical doctor, Dr. Alvin Nah-Doe, Neurosurgeon at the JFK Hospital said the driver was not shot and was not in a critical condition.Full Text: Martin Kollie, a social activist, claimed on September 13, 2021, that National Transit Authority (NTA) driver Jessy Bartuah was shot in his head.The vehicle escorted partisans and well-wishers of Mulbah Morlu, Chairman, Coalition for Democratic Change from the Roberts International Airport (RIA) to the party’s headquarters in Monrovia.“Jessy Bartuah was one of the drivers of those assigned buses. The buses finally arrived at CDC Headquarters amid huge confusion/conflict between rivalled partisans. The struggle for control and cash stirred this conflict.“As the conflict intensified, someone in the crowd fired LIVE bullets and one of the bullets hit the head of NTA driver Jessy Bartuah. The Government, including LNP, has been begging the family of Bartuah not to release this info.

FOR THE INVINCIBLE SPORTS PARK
SINKOR, MONROVIA, LIBERIA

FEBRUARY 10, 2021

FELLOW LIBERIANS:
Today has brought me yet another opportunity to share my dreams and aspirations for the happiness and well-being of our citizens, by providing modern recreational facilities that will contribute to their good health, wellbeing, and fitness.

We have come to break ground for the INVINCIBLE SPORTS PARK, a multi-purpose complex that will contain basketball courts, tennis courts, volleyball courts, walking trails, a children’s playground, and an outdoor gym, together with adequate sanitary facilities. As a public park, it will be freely accessible and

available to everyone who seeks to use it.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

I attended the Ellen Mills Scarborough Junior High School right across the road from here. If you look keenly you will see the school building still standing there. And I also practiced here during my days when I played for the Invincible Eleven Majestic Sports Association. I broke my first record in the high school league right here on this field by defeating the famous Wells Hairston High School when I played for the Muslim Congress High School on the other side of this airfield, called The Bench Old-Timers Field…right over there.

So you can see that I know this area very well. This area and piece of land, unstructured and undeveloped as it was, has been used for recreational purposes for many decades by the general public in Monrovia. In fact, this is one of the first places in Monrovia where I used to practice soccer in my youthful days.

And so it has the distinction and honour of producing the first and only Liberian and the first African to have won the World’s Best Footballer title, the Ballon d’Ór.

You will also recall that this area has played another important and very meaningful role in our Nation’s history when it served for many years as the site where hundreds of Liberian women, wearing white, prayed for peace to return to our land. They were here as Prayer Warriors for our Nation, in the heat and in the rain, laying on the ground and sitting in the sand, with no shelter from the elements.

And as we all now know, they were very successful. Their prayers were heard by the Almighty God, and their efforts were rewarded with a lasting and sustainable peace that we have enjoyed for almost two decades now.

In recognition, gratitude, and appreciation of their patriotic efforts, this Park will contain a special Prayer Ground area for them to pray, which will feature turf under their feet and shelter over their heads.

And yet, for some reasons best known to my predecessor, Her Excellency Madam Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, former President of the Republic of Liberia, chose to shut this place down, thereby denying our people the simple pleasures of recreation and relaxation in the open air. Well, just as HER job is to CLOSE it, it is MY job to OPEN it.

Since no one cared to do anything about it after more than 30 years, it is MY job to FIX it. When she spoil it, I will FIX it.

I, therefore, want you to know that I am developing this public park as my personal contribution to the people of this area. There will be other parks that will be built with public funds, but I feel a burning desire and sense of obligation to GIVE BACK to this community because of what this place has contributed to my success in the world of soccer.

And let me also inform you that, before doing so, I made a formal application to the Liberian Civil Aviation Authority for approval to locate this facility here, because of its close proximity to Spriggs Airport, and permission was granted on the basis of my undertaking that all heights and elevations would comply with the requirements of the aviation regulator. Additionally, it will be situated a safe distance from the runway, as determined by the LCAA, and there will be no buildings erected in the Park.

AND NOW, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, FELLOW LIBERIANS:

Before I cut the ribbon, I just want to tell you that it does not take OPULENCE to do this. All it takes is selfless love for your people, thoughtful care for their feelings, and genuine concern for their happiness and well-being.

So, Ladies and Gentlemen, as I break ground for this INVINCIBLE SPORTS PARK, I ask you to TRAIN WELL, BE FIT, BE INSPIRED, and DEVELOP YOUR GAME!

I thank you.

Verification: But on the contrary to President Weah’s promise to build the park as his “personal contribution” to the people of the Airfield Community where the park is located, it has been established that funding towards the construction of the park will come from the national budget of the country.

In the 2022 draft budget, funding allocation to the invincible park is captured under the budget line of the Ministry of State.

There are also proposed budget allocations from 2022- 2024 in the Draft National Budget Fiscal year 2022.

Conclusion: Despite President Weah’s promise that the construction will be his personal contribution; and the same construction is allocated in the draft national budget, the claim is Misleading.

Because the park will be funded through the national budget instead of the President’s personal contribution.",14/12/2021,https://tsmliberia.com/explainer-who-is-funding-construction-of-the-invincible-park/,0
Coffin resembling phallus was used to bury Ghanaian man who performed...,The Stage Media-Liberia,"A Facebook post claiming that a woman Who Had 10 Kids With 10 Different buried in a coffin-shaped like a man’s genitals has been shared thousands of times.

But the claim is misleading; the picture of the coffin published on Facebook comes from Ghana and shows the funeral of a man who conducted traditional male circumcisions in his community, locally known as a wanzam.

Claim: A woman has been laid to rest in a casket designed in a form of a man’s private part.

Full Text: A post published by African Report Files Facebook page on November 15, 2021, shared two images of a coffin-shaped like a circumcised penis surrounded by a crowd.


Screenshot of African Report Files
“Woman Who Had 10 Kids With 10 Different Men Buried In P€nis-like Casket- A woman has been laid to rest in a casket designed in a form of a man’s private part.”

The same claim was shared in Nigeria, South Africa, Uganda and Cameroon.

This story was published on Pulse, Reddit



This tweet from an account that describes itself as a Zimbabwean online news feed shared a similar claim but purported that the deceased was a woman who had died during intercourse.

Verification: A search on social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle revealed that the claim has been shared by various humour pages and groups. From some of the comments, people appeared to believe the claim about the coffin belonging to a sex worker who died.

A reverse image search showed media reports (here and here) indicating that the casket was the final resting place of a man from  Ghana who practiced traditional male circumcisions.

An online search revealed that when images of the casket began spreading on the internet in July 2020, it led to the publication of articles here and here claiming the person buried in the coffin was a woman sex worker.

However, this Ghanian television station interviewed William Kpalpo Allotey, the brother of the deceased, John Nii Addo Allotey, and he confirmed that the family’s choice of the coffin was intended to honour the decades-long work of his brother.

“In our community, the profession you are involved in, the type of work you do, is what we use to design the casket used for your burial. For a fisherman, we design a fish for you and since this man was a wanzam, we designed a human sexual organ for the burial,” Allotey said during the interview with Television CK.

Coffin designs in Ghana can be personalized based on a client’s life, dreams, passions, profession and status (see reports here, here and here).

Isaac Tettehfio, who runs an Instagram page showcasing the business’ fancy coffins, said that while he has designed penis-shaped coffins before, he does not recall making one for a sex worker.

Conclusion: However, while the image is genuine and the coffin was real, the claim is misleading.",05/12/2021,https://tsmliberia.com/coffin-resembling-phallus-was-used-to-bury-ghanaian-man-who-performed-circumcisions-not-a-woman-who-had-10-kids/,1
Fact Check: Integrity Teen Emmanuel Tolue Did Not Falsify His Document,The Stage Media-Liberia,"It has been a huge debate in the last two weeks both on social media and in the public about the situation of little Emmanuel Tolue who recently enrolled at the Ricks Institute in furtherance of his high school education.

Emmanuel Tolue is the Liberia youngster who found and returned US$50,000 to its owner in Nimba County.

Since demonstrating what many saw as huge integrity amid the thought economic times the Liberian teen has been celebrated across the world and won for himself a scholarship from President George Weah to study up to Masters Degree.

The teen told an interview in his native Nimba County one of the counties in Liberia that prior to coming across the huge sum of money, he was a motorcycle taxi rider and have since dropped out of school for several years due to lack of support.

After his recognition by President Weah and other institutions across Liberia, Tolue, 19, registered at the Ricks Institute and is currently in the sixth grade.

But several social media (Facebook) users have posted claiming that the celebrated Liberian teen was demoted by the school and that he falsified his education documents taken to the institution.

Social Media Accounts:

Hot Spot Gist – Breaking!!!!! “Emmanuel Tolue the integrity icon has been demoted from 7th grade to 6th grade in Ricks Institute. According to the principal of the institution, Emmanuel Tolue needs to start from six (6th) grade or even below because he has been out of school for a longer period of time and his performance is low. This life em, if integrity icon cannot make it in school let the lay boy sit down and manage hi mula.”

Dunk-News Now: Breaking News! “Despite overnight integrity icon Emmanuel Tolue disgraceful demotion by the Ricks Institute’s Administration recently, news coming in says the man of few words will receive another award in Nigeria on the 9th of December. According to the report, the overnight integrity icon was demoted for speaking very terrible and bad English mixed with Gio (Native tongue) in class.

Bryon Bryon: “This CDC agent uncover who was recently tagged as an “Integrity Icon” has been demoted from 7th Grade to 6th Grade by Ricks Institute Board on the basis he tried to cheat on his education by taking a class he was unfit for. Some of us said that this kid was an amazing criminal, sponsored  by George Weah in order to capture Nimba COUNTY. Didn’t I say that his Koko-Story about finding money was a complete grandstand??….. Small CDC rogue!!

Ricks Institute Acting Principal

To verify the claims made by these social media accounts and many others, The Stage Media conducted an exclusive interview with Mr. Klahn-Gboloh Jarbah, the Acting Principal of Ricks Institute in Virginia.

Mr. Jarbah made it clear to TSM that the school did not demote Emmanuel Tolue nor did the teen provide fake education documents to the school as claimed.

“We do not demote here. What we did was that we asked Emmanuel to take a step back to prepare him since he was out of school for a very long time.” He said.

“We have our benchmark that you must reach when you come to our school. If for some reason if you do not reach that benchmark we say to the parent and we say to the parent you have to take one step back so that we can prepare you for one step forward. And it is not also unusual at Ricks Institute for a student who has performed to be promoted to the next class as a double promotion in the middle of the year or at the end of the year. And the Emmanuel situation is no exception.” Jarbah says.

“Coming to Ricks Institute from a different school particularly in the Emmanuel situation where had said to the whole world that he was out of school for so many years riding a motorcycle, so even if he was in tenth grade there will challenges for him to continue because of the longevity of time he stayed out of school.” He mentioned.

The Acting Principal of Ricks Institute said every Liberian must begin to applaud little Emmanuel Tolue for accepting to come to Ricks Institute and noted that many in his case wouldn’t have done so.

“It is a good thing that this young has decided to sit here at Ricks Institute among students that are even younger than he is in a class that traditionally at his age he will not sit in. I think we need to commend him. It should not be a political issue, it should not a social media issue, it should be an issue that every Liberian should applaud this young man for humanity, discipline and the willingness to do what he is doing.” Mr. Jarbah noted.

According to him, his institution has done nothing out of the ordinary for admitting him and applying the school’s standard on him for his own good.

Mr. Jarbah noted that Emmanuel Tolue has every opportunity to reach 8th Grade before the end of this year (2021-2021 academic year) and that will be based on his own initiative and with the help coming from the faculty and other students of the institution.

Respond to Claims of Fake Document

Klahn-Gboloh Jarbah, Ricks Institute Acting Principal told TSM that Tolue did not take with him any documents to the institution on grounds that he was out of school for a very long period of time while riding his motorcycle.

“Why will anybody in 5th or 6th Grade falsify documents, to achieve what? What documents will a person of that lower call have? This is not a university, a law school or a medical school and you are trying to get it all to cost? What can he bring from Nimba county to justify or falsify any documents to enter Ricks Institute or any school for that matter? I think it is crazy that anyone will make that claim that he came here with forged documents.” He said.",26/11/2021,https://tsmliberia.com/fact-check-integrity-teen-emmanuel-tolue-did-not-falsify-his-document/,1

"No, US Democracy Meeting is Virtual and not In-Person Summit",The Stage Media-Liberia,"Claim: US President Joe Biden has invited Liberia’s President George Weah to the United States to attend the Democracy summit. The claim is False, the Democracy meeting will be virtual and not in person. Full Text: Aloysius Howe, a social media user on November 12, posted on his Facebook page that the United States of America President, Joe Biden has invited President George Weah to participate in the United States government First Summit for Democracy. “The summit will be hosted by U.S. President Joe Biden and President George Weah received the invitation because of his administration’s “Consistent Commitment to Non-Violent, Free and Fair Elections.” The 2021 summit is scheduled for December 9-10 and it is to focus on challenges, opportunities facing democracies and will provide a platform for leaders to make both individuals and collective commitments to defend democracy and human rights at home and platform and human rights at home and abroad. It is the first of two summits that will bring together leaders from government, civil society and the private sector to set forth an affirmative agenda for democratic renewal and to tackle the greatest threats faced by democracies today through collective action. Experts from government, multilateral organizations, philanthropies, civil society and the private sector to solicit bold, practical ideas will be consulted around three key themes: Defending against authoritarianism, Addressing and fighting corruption and Advancing respect for human rights. The post attracted 251 comments and 62 shares from Facebook users. Verification: US Ambassador Michael McCarthy in his monthly press roundtable announced the summit. On Liberia’s selection, the U.S. Envoy said the last three presidential elections, the peaceful transfer of power in 2017 and the government’s consistent commitment to nonviolent, free and fair elections exemplify why Liberia was invited. Speaking further, he noted that the Summit for Democracy is not a celebration for world leaders to congratulate themselves on a job well done. “It is a call to renewed action, because Democracies by their nature, are constant work in progress, very much including our own,” he said. “United States’ President Joe Biden will host the virtual summit for leaders from government, civil society, and the private sector to set forth an affirmative agenda for democratic renewal and to tackle through collective action the greatest threats faced by democracies today.”, said Ambassador McCarthy. The State Department website and the White House published that the summit will be done virtually instead of in person. When the claim was posted the user was asked if the summit was in-person or virtual, the poster said it is in-person and not virtual.

Is Varkan Ege the first International Vessel at Harper Port in...,The Stage Media-Liberia,"Claim: First International vessel lands at the port of Harper, Maryland County since the end of Liberia’s civil conflict. The Varkan Ege is NOT the first International Vessel at the port of Harper in 31 years. Full Text: On November 10, the Public Relations Director of the National Port Authority (NPA) Malcolm Scott took to his Facebook page with a post that a Giant size Vessel, Varkan Ege- nearing 100 meters long with 35488 SDW and Gross tonnage of 2222 has berthed at the Port of Harper in wake of massive infrastructure development in that Southern port. He claimed that this is the first of its kind in more than three decades(31) years – Since the end of Liberia’s civil war( 1990). “The berthing of Varkan Ege signals a leap steep to brand new developments of the port operation and the purpose for which it was originally built.” He said, “This is in line with the government’s vision to refurbish and operationalize the Ports to ensure super economic activities throughout the country.” The National Port Authority (NPA) was established by an Act of the National Legislature in 1967 and amended in 1970 as a state-owned corporation to manage, plan, and build all public ports in Liberia. The NPA system has four ports: Freeport of Monrovia, Port of Buchanan, Port of Greenville, and Port of Harper. The Freeport of Monrovia is the largest and the main Port within the Authority’s network. The post attracted 35 comments and 13 shares. One social media user Emmanuel Dillon wrote: “Small bro Malcolm, please research and change the years. For a little info, I was reassigned to the Free Port of Monrovia 2003 from the Port of Harper, and while there we received a minimum of three international vessels every month. Correct this, please don’t let others take u for a joker. And mind you, they continue to come after I left not until MODEL (the rebel group) captured Harper that they stopped.” Verification: The Stage Media contacted Matilda Parker, NPA’s Former Director, she disclosed a 2010/11 report that shows vessels traffic and cargo traffic at the port of Harper. The report shows that at Harper 49 vessels entered and were cleared, also Summer Deadweight was 69,856. For the cargo traffic, Harper port recorded 2,770.1 cargo, 617.4-export in 2010 while in 2011 its import was 10,298 and export -1,878.8 that sum up to 15,564.3. Journalist Bryan Dioh previously posted on his page “#stilljournalistwithoutbounder# First International Vessel anchor on Harper Sea Port after the 1990 post-war. Details coming up in several News outlets. ”But a user George Tò Blede Davis wrote: “1990? So the vessels that were carrying timbers during Taylor’s regime were not International Vessels? Phoenix 102.7 reporter Bryan later posted to clarify;“ #stilljournalistwithoutbounder# Haven investigated issues surrounding the international Vessel which anchor today at the Harper port, it is clear from all indications that this is not the first Vessel that anchor since after the 1990 war.. Thanks to all those who provided the necessary information and special thanks to most of our old folks for the historical analysis provided during my background investigation. ”At the same time, the NPA website shows that the Port of Harper has increased to 11 vessels that amounting to 33%. Otis Brown, ex-employee of the port disclosed that during the Charles Taylor regime the (TTCO)Togba Timber Cooperation and (MWPI)Maryland Workers Processing Incorporation had vessels coming from the International waters exporting logs and Oil respectively. According to him, these companies operated before the 2003- MODEL War. The 2003 war ended brought to an end international vessels anchoring at the Harper Port. Conclusion: False, the Varkan Ege is NOT the first International Vessel at the port of Harper in 31 years. It is right to say after the 2003 war, the Varkan Ege is Not the first international vessel to anchor at the port of Harper. It has been 18 years instead of 31 years as stated by NPA’s Public Relations Director Malcolm Scott.

Fact Check: Did Dr. Amos Sawyer Overstay 12 years at the...,The Stage Media-Liberia,"Claim: Amos Sawyer overstayed 12 years at the Governance Commission even though his tenure expired. Verdict: True but, Dr. Amos Sawyer spent eight years serving as chairman of the Governance Commission but prior to his appointment, he was serving the Governance Reform Commission that was transformed to the Governance Commission. Full Text: When HOTT FM radio talk show host Daniel Rogers appeared on the show, Monday morning, he claimed that Dr. Amos Sawyer stayed 12 years at the Governance Commission even though his tenure has expired. Dr. Sawyer is the former Head of the Interim Government of National Unity (IGNU) of Liberia, He served as Interim President of Liberia from November 22, 1990, to March 7, 1994). He was also the former Chairman of the Panel of Eminent Persons, African Peer Review Mechanism (African Union) from 2010 to 2014. Verification: According to the Executive Mansion website, Dr. Sawyer was appointed on August 5, 2008, and in 2013 he was reappointed to the commission. Prior to the 2008 appointment, he then served as chairman of the Governance Reform Commission now Governance Commission. The act establishing the Governance Commission in section 5.4.1 states; “Tenure” states that the commission shall serve a term of four years and may be re-appointed for an additional term of 4-years; provided that in no instance shall a commissioner serve more than two terms , whether successive or separate . Service by the commissioners shall conform to the terms of reference of the appointments, not inconsistent with the provision of this act. Conclusion: The claim that Dr. Sawyer stayed 12 years at the Governance Commission is partly true; however, it is safe to say that before the Governance Commission was established in 2007, it was previously called the Governance Reform Commission which existed from 2003 to 2005. The previous years from 2006 to 2008 were years of setting up after President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf resigned from the Governance Reform Commission to contest the election in 2005. Dr. Sawyer officially took over as Chairman of the Governance Commission in 2009 and left in 2017. Counting the years prior to those years of setting up when it was never a full Commission and the years of being Chairman will add to 12 years but only eight years were under the Governance Commission.",28/10/2021,https://tsmliberia.com/fact-check-did-dr-amos-sawyer-overstay-12-years-at-the-governance-commission/,1

"Assessing Nicki Minaj’s claim COVID-19 vaccine could cause impotence, swollen testicles",The Stage Media-Liberia,"The music star wrote: “My cousin in Trinidad won’t get the vaccine cuz his friend got it & became impotent. His testicles became swollen. His friend was weeks away from getting married, now the girl called off the wedding. So just pray on it & make sure you’re comfortable with ur decision, not bullied.” Claim: Nicki Minaj, an American-Trinidadian rapper, recently made a post, via her Twitter page, suggesting that the COVID-19 vaccine could cause impotence and swelling of the testicles. There is no evidence to show that taking a jab of the COVID-19 vaccine could lead to impotence and swelling of the testicles. Full Text On September 13, Nicki Minaj, a popular musician, posted via her Twitter page that her cousin had refused to take the COVID-19 vaccine because his friend who took it became impotent and ended up with swollen testicles. She added that the said friend to her cousin was just weeks away from getting married when the incident happened, adding that because of the development, his bride called off their scheduled wedding. In the post — which has garnered over 148,000 likes, 118,000 retweets and 44,000 comments — the rapper encouraged her followers to pray and ensure they are convinced before they take the vaccine. The music star wrote: “My cousin in Trinidad won’t get the vaccine cuz his friend got it & became impotent. His testicles became swollen. His friend was weeks away from getting married, now the girl called off the wedding. So just pray on it & make sure you’re comfortable with ur decision, not bullied. ”Due to her status as a global pop star with far-reaching influence in countries such as Nigeria, her tweet further heightened the fears of many about getting the COVID-19 vaccine. Minaj has over 227 million followers across Instagram, Twitter and Facebook pages. Her claim had come at a time when several forms of misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccine are making the rounds on social media in several countries including Nigeria. As a result of the global impact of the virus, there has been an overwhelming amount of information on social media, websites and mainstream media about the virus with a mass audience willing to consume such pieces of information. As with other disease outbreaks, the COVID-19 pandemic left people seeking answers to both professional and unprofessional means of prevention, symptoms, cures, and how this may possibly impact the way the world revolves. However, the increased access to information resulted in the spread of misinformation. For instance, In 2014 while the devastating Ebola epidemic raged in parts of West Africa, a viral WhatsApp broadcast prescribed bathing with or drinking salt and hot water mixtures as a “cure” for the dreaded disease. Even though there was no medical basis for the claim, the “prescription” went viral enough for the government to have to officially debunk it. But that ultimately proved futile, as at least two people died and several others were hospitalized over excessive salt consumption. The same tempo of misinformation applied to the effect of COVID-19 on Nigeria’s economy and people with influence ranging from religious leaders, among others. Since the introduction of the COVID-19 vaccines, there have been conspiracy theories on the side effects of the vaccine on those who choose to get vaccinated. Nigerian televangelist Christopher Oghenebrorie Okotie, who is also Pastor of the Household of God Church International Ministries, claimed in a viral video that taking the COVID-19 vaccine would turn recipients into vampires. Also, the founder of LoveWorld Incorporated, Pastor Chris Oyakhilome, said Christians should believe in the word of God rather than in the vaccine. Recently, some videos circulated the internet where some individuals alleged to have received the COVID vaccine claimed that when a LED bulb is placed against the spot where the vaccine is injected, it lights up. These claims have however been debunked. Therefore, Minaj’s tweet has continued to ignite debate on the possible dangers of taking the vaccine across the world. Verification According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the COVID-19 vaccines are effective at protecting people against severe disease and death from variants of the virus. The centre acknowledges that after taking the vaccine, there is a probability of developing side effects, but noted that such is only temporary. It also revealed that common side effects of the COVID-19 vaccines on people include: pain, redness and swelling on the spot where one gets injected. It added that those who have received the vaccine may experience tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, fever and nausea. “Serious side effects that could cause a long-term health problem are extremely unlikely following any vaccination, including COVID-19 vaccination,” it said. It, however, explicitly states that the vaccine does not affect impotence and swelling of the testicles as Minaj’s tweet claimed. It said: “Currently no evidence shows that any vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines, cause male fertility problems. A recent small study of 45 healthy men who received an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (i.e., Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) looked at sperm characteristics, like quantity and movement, before and after vaccination. Researchers found no significant changes in these sperm characteristics after vaccination. “Fever from illness has been associated with a short-term decrease in sperm production in healthy men. Although fever can be a side effect of COVID-19 vaccination, there is no current evidence that fever after COVID-vaccination affects sperm production. ”Similarly, Trinidad and Tobago Health Minister, Terrence Deyalsingh, has dismissed Minaj’s claim, describing the musician’s tweet as “false.” “As we stand now, there is absolutely no reported such side effect or adverse event of testicular swelling in Trinidad or, I dare say, anywhere else in the world,” he said. In an interview with
CNN, Anthony Fauci, chief medical advisor to Joe Biden, US president, also faulted Minaj’s claim, saying her claim lacks evidence. “There’s no evidence that it happens, nor is there any mechanistic reason to imagine that it would happen. So the answer to your question is no,” he said. “There’s a lot of misinformation, mostly on social media, and the only way we know to counter mis- and disinformation is to provide a lot of correct information.“ To essentially debunk these kinds of claims, which may be innocent on her part, I’m not blaming her for anything, but she should be thinking twice about propagating information that really has no basis.” Conclusion Nicki Minaj’s tweet suggesting that the COVID-19 vaccine could lead to impotence and swelling of the testicles is false. There is no scientific evidence to substantiate such a claim.",05/10/2021,https://tsmliberia.com/assessing-nicki-minajs-claim-covid-19-vaccine-could-cause-impotence-swollen-testicles/,1
"Fact Check -False, The UN did Not Issue this Alert on...",The Stage Media-Liberia,"Claim: UN issued an alert on the black market for human body organs in the Middle East.Verdict: FalseFull Text: A social media message circulated on messenger and WhatsApp showing an alert reportedly from the United Nations, giving a warning on a black market for human body organs in the Middle East. It lists the most valuable organs. According to this alert, a kidney is said to cost $262,000, a heart, $119,000, and a liver $157,000.

Does waxing or shaving of woman’s pubic hair cause microscopic trauma?,The Stage Media-Liberia,"Photo credit: Gilleteby:Funmilola AfolabiClaim: A Gynecologist, Dr. Jen Gunther, warned that waxing or shaving of a woman’s pubic hair can cause ‘microscopic trauma’ and lead to infections.Verdict: Frequently shaving or waxing one’s pubic hair could lead to cuts which in turn aids infection when not properly treated and this can also dampen a woman’s arousal during sexual intercourse.Full TextAn online mediumTrojan Newsposted an article of a gynecologist, Dr. Jen Gunther, urging women not to remove their pubic hair.In the article, thegynecologist and author of The Vagina Bible werequoted as saying “waxing or shaving creates microscopic trauma that can lead to infections.”“Getting a Brazilian may also reduce pleasure, with the pubic hair being connected to nerve endings that might help arousal,” Dr. Gunter added.Screenshot of the postPubic HairPubic hair is basically body hair that is found and located in the genital area of human beings. The hair is present on and around the sexual organs. It is found in the scrotum (male) and vulva (female).Over the years, having a bare and smooth skin has become a common practicefor people all over the world regardless of their gender. This practice, just as in some climes, has become a norm to have the public hair removed and is often regarded as part of personal hygiene.And as such, it has become a routine for some women to shave or wax their hair especially around the private part. Though the removal of pubic hair is generally safe, there are some common side effects. These include:-Itching-Cuts-Rashes-Infections-Burns from chemical removersSo, those waxing and shaving of a woman’s pubic hair cause microscopic trauma leading to infections.Microscopic TraumaMicroscopic trauma which is also known as microtraumais basically any small injury that is usually one of a series that can lead to major injuries. It can include the micro-tearing of muscle fibers, the sheath around the muscle, and the connective tissue.Microscopic injuries are overuse injuries from persistent and repetitive motionsthat can cause microscopic damage, muscle and connective tissue imbalances that can over time alter and limit activities. The area of injury undergoes a mechanical stress reaction that may sometimes include microtears, inflammation, swelling, and tenderness, usually in a pointed area.Early microtrauma may not be detectable, obvious, painful, or have any swelling. However, as the overuse continues with time, the microscopic imbalance becomes extreme, and extra tear weakens the flesh while tissue degeneration increases until symptoms or physical limitations manifest.Can waxing and shaving of the pubic hair cause microscopic trauma leading to infections and reducing arousal for a woman?VerificationA Consultant Gynecologist with the University of Medical sciences teaching hospital, Ondo (UNIMEDTH), Dr. Olukayode Lawal, said microscopic trauma occurs when the pubic hair is removed often.According to him, ‘For every cycle of shaving, in the course of the regrowth of hair, there is a tendency that the rate at which the various hair growth occurs could be a point or site for infection. Depending on the method used to get rid of the pubic hair, one could either suffer a cut or injury, so as much as one sweats or inserts a foreign object in that area, it could lead to a risk of infection. If one has unprotected sex, it could be a source of sexually transmitted infection.’While reacting to the claim that waxing could reduce pleasure, Dr. Lawal said every structure in that perennial region is well vascularized and so could be easily stimulated and as such a cut in that region could lead to pain during sex, thus increasing the possibility of contacting sexual infection.Dr Lawal, however, advised that women should limit the removal of their pubic hair and only do so when it is well grown.A Gynecologist, Dr. Victor Adefesoye, said there is an average possibility of waxing and shaving of the pubic hair causing microscopic trauma which could lead to infections.“There is a 50-50 chance of this happening and that is because if one has a cut in the pubic area and such is not well taken care of, it could lead to infections. However, it is not true in cases, where the removal of pubic hair does not leave an injury behind. So, if there is an injury, it could lead to infection sometimes, only if not well taken care of.”While also speaking on the possibility of pubic hair removal reducing pleasure, Dr. Adefesoye said there would be reduced arousal if the woman suffers an injury in the course of shaving or waxing the public area.“If there is a cut in the public region and she is engaged in a sexual activity, the cut could be painful to the woman and that could reduce the woman’s libido thereby leading to reduced pleasure,” he said.He, therefore, opined that cuts or injuries suffered during the removal of pubic hair could reduce sexual pleasure.Studieshave also shown that grooming one’s pubic hair can be harmful to one’s health asone-quarter of peoplewho shave or wax are injuring themselves. The biggest risk in getting nicked while removing pubic hair is that small cuts can let in bacteria.Researchers also found a linkbetween more frequent grooming and sexually transmitted diseases, such as herpes or syphilis.ConclusionFrequently shaving or waxing one’s pubic hair could lead to cuts which in turn aid infection when not properly treated and this can also dampen a woman’s arousal during sexual intercourse.The researcher produced this fact check article per the Dubawa 2021 Kwame KariKari Fellowship partnership with Crest FM to facilitate the ethos of “truth” in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.Related ",16/09/2021,https://tsmliberia.com/does-waxing-or-shaving-of-womans-pubic-hair-cause-microscopic-trauma/,1
Does corn silk cure diseases as claimed in this video?,The Stage Media-Liberia,"TikTok  User Claim: A viral TikTok video, forwarded many times on WhatsApp in Nigeria, claims corn silk cures several diseases.
More context is needed. While there exists some record that corn silk helps in promoting wellbeing, there is insufficient information about dosage and duration of treatment to cure specific diseases.
Full TextThere is a paradigm shift from Evidence Based Medicine (EBM), (which involves the use of only evidence-based methods and medications in treating patients) to a nutrition based approach in which many experts and private individuals promote general wellness and disease prevention/treatment using food and other locally available herbs and spices.While nutrition plays a significant role in health and wellbeing, there is insufficient evidence that food can be used to cure serious diseases like cancer and other major illnesses once they occur.
A viral video that has been forwarded many times on WhatsApp in Nigeria claims that corn silk cures many diseases. The 35 seconds video shows a woman demonstrating how to prepare corn silk for treatment. She asks viewers to “boil some water, put in the corn silk, turn off the stove and let it simmer for 30 minutes and drink the water”. She went on to say that the mixture is very good for curing “bladder infection, kidney stones, heart failure, inflammation of the prostate, urinary system, and diabetes.” She ended by noting that “simple things in life will give healing, it’s all about life changes” and encourages everyone to “try it.”

Did 82 Percent of Liberians Agree to Transitional Justice?,The Stage Media-Liberia,"Pic Credit: FPAClaim: “82.2 percent of the Liberian population opted for transitional justice or the Palaver Hut discussion to settle issues surrounding our civil war” – Syrenius Cephus, Solicitor GeneralVerdict: False. There is no evidence that 82.2 percent of the Liberian population opted for Transitional justice or the Palaver hut discussion to settle issues surrounding our civil war.Full TextWhen Solicitor General (SG) Cephus appeared on OK FM, on August 2, 2021, he claimed that “82.2 percent of the Liberian population opted for transitional justice or the palaver hut discussion to settle issues surrounding our civil war.”Cllr Cephus in an interview said his source was the TRC report.“You have to read the report, it is stated there, my reliance is the TRC,” he said.In Liberia, there have been calls from both local and international countries for the establishment of a war crimes court to bring justice to those bearing higher responsibility for Liberia’s more than a decade-long bloody civil war.But the SG says 82.2% of Liberians agreed to transitional justice instead of a war crimes court.Councilor Cephus also claimed that in the absence of what he calls total stability, the government would not opt for the establishment of such a tribunal.Liberia went through civil crises which resulted in the destruction of lives and properties, including the loss of approximately 250,000 lives and the displacement of thousands of Liberians, when a crisis engulfed the country in 1989.VerificationThis researcher perused the Truth Reconciliation Commission (TRC) report which the SG said he relied on and found that although there were palava huts on transitional justice forums, there was no mention of the percentage of Liberians who opted for it.Fubbi Henries, a War Crimes Court activist, also says there has been no survey conducted in Liberia to ascertain the total number of people who preferred transitional justice.“The claim is a lie,” he said in reaction to the claim.At the same time, Tennen Dalieh, a doctoral student at Dublin City University researching universal jurisdiction, transitional justice, peacebuilding and reconciliation in Liberia, said in an interview that there is no record of 82 percent of Liberians consenting to transitional justice.“There is absolutely no record that 82 percent agreed to transitional justice,” Dalieh said.BackgroundThe Senate endorsed the recommendation of its leadership committee to set up a Transitional Justice Commission (TJC).The plenary action of TJC came as a response to the request of President George Weah for advice on how his administration should proceed in handling the recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC).The unanimous decision was taken by the senate after expert opinions and inputs were solicited from the Solicitor General of Liberia, Saymah Syrenius Cephus, the Liberian National Bar Association and other interested parties.The TJC is to analyze the TRC report and give further recommendations to the President.ConclusionThere is no evidence that 82.2 percent of the Liberian population opted for transitional justice or the palaver hut discussion to settle issues surrounding Liberia’s civil war. According to the TRC report, though there were town hall meetings, there is no record that 82 percent of Liberians opted for transitional justice.Related ",09/09/2021,https://tsmliberia.com/did-82-percent-of-liberians-agree-to-transitional-justice/,1

Now those that have money are transporting those goods by the way of canoe paying fifty Liberian dollars per beg of rice to have it loaded on cars across the river,’’ driver Kolubah Bein said.Prince Quiah one of the canoe paddlers said ‘’ we cross people in the canoe 100 LD per person, motorbike 250 LD and we charge you base on the weight of your load. We feel discourage base on this situation that’s why we are here to help our people because if we leave them accident may occurred’’.For his part, the deputy chief driver for transport union Sanniquellie chapter Alex Brown appealed to the central government in making a frantic effort through the Senegalese Construction Company CSE in fast striking the road project.
Those that have their canoe have their own prices, sometimes they will ask pedestrians to pay according to their own way. I have seen them collecting money like 300, 250, 200,150, 100 and 50  Liberian Dollars as fees to cross people, loads and motorbike so to frankly tell you the exact money to cross seems difficult, there is luck in the price’’, Alex Brown said.Conclusion: True, the road under construction by the SENEGALESE CONSTRUCTION COMPANY CSE got disconnected after the heavy down pull of rain on Tuesday, August 31, 2021",06/09/2021,https://tsmliberia.com/are-motor-vehicles-and-pedestrians-still-plying-the-sanniquelle-ganta-highway/,1
"Liberia: How Fake News, Rumor, Misinformation Undercut Public Health Interventions During Outbreak",Alpha Daffae Senkpeni,"Monrovia – Curbing the spread of any virus outbreak requires meticulousand robust public health interventions as well as effective risk communicationstrategies. So, when fake rumors and news are penetrating the public sphere,the virus itself does not seem to be the only problem to solve.The confirmation of the first COVID-19 case in Liberia on March 16sparked a lot of rumors, leaving social media buzzing with thousands of postsand comments — some from media sources others based on people’s perceptions.  And these perceptions, which come from non-scientists or health experts,are most likely based on unconfirmed studies, rumor, misinformation andmisconceptions.This situation resembles what unfolded during the Ebola epidemic back in2015, when denials, conspiracy theories and fake rumors about the viralhaemorrhagic fever significantly disrupted public health interventions.Months later, severe damage was already done – over a thousand peoplehad died before the country would realize that effective communication wasvital to rolling back the epidemic.Fake News,Misinformation Swirling Now, as Covid-19 spreads its tentacles across the world including inLiberia, experienced health journalists and public health experts are againwarning that spreading rumors during outbreaks doesn’t only impede healthinterventions; it also spreads fear and panic in the population.Already, there have been varieties of fake newsand rumor spreading in Liberia. Recently, rumor spread that the government waspreparing to spray the air as a means of eradicating COVID-19. Others alsorumored that the “spraying” was intended to infect a significant amount of thepopulation with the Coronavirus.Before the “spraying” rumor gained traction,several social media users shared a fake certificate purportedly signed by theUnited Nations’ Secretary General to the first confirmed patient of COVID-19 inthe country, declaring him cured from the virus. The fake certificate, the government later said,was part of a scheme to convince the public that there was no case in the country.It followed pockets of discussions on the radio, social media and incommunities, speculating that there was no case of the virus in the country andthat the government was only trying to lure some of the money dedicated tostopping the virus and provided by the World Bank and other internationalorganizations. Dr. MosoKa Fallah, Director of NPHIL, appeared wary of the spread offake news and misinformation when he gave a Facebook live update of thecountry’s three confirmed cases. He then expressed a “passionate appeal” to Liberians while cautioningthat “in the midst of this very serious outbreak, people are bent on spreadingmisinformation and disinformation”.“This is so dangerous to the country,” the head of Liberia’s publichealth institute warned of the rumor that had to do with the spraying thecountry.“How can you do this to your country? In the midst of this thing when weface a global threat… you’re being too unfair to the country.” But Joyce Kilikpo, a Liberianpublic health practitioner, says rumors are easily believed by many Liberiansbecause they lack trust in the government. This is a situation thatexacerbates during disease and virus outbreaks, she added, while suggestingthat “clear and concise information” can be the antidote to misinformation andmistrust during health emergencies. “We need to make sure during publichealth crises our trusted institutions, clinicians, churches, mosques,community organizations, local NGOs, and the media are better educated andinformed on what’s ongoing,” said the head of a local NGO – Public HealthInitiative Liberia. Like Dr. Fallah, Ms. Kilikpo thinksthe growing rate of misinformation and rumors is threatening the response andpreparedness efforts put in place to curb the further spread of the virus.She suggests that frequent updatesabout the outbreak by health authorities would likely limit the spread ofmisinformation. “Telling the population exactlywhat you are doing and what you are not doing helps to regain their trust andallow the people to adhere to messages for behavior change during public healthemergencies.” Related Posts Liberia: DO THEY DESERVE YOUR VOTE?

Biological…  Jul 24, 2023 Meanwhile, there have been ostensibly swiftresponses in refuting misinformation by government spokespersons but the threatof fake news and rumor are still hovering.Disrupts Interventions Katharina Thomas, a British-American global health journalist, sayspeople often “cling on to rumors because they [rumor] give them a sense thatthere is a simple solution to a health problem”.Thomas, who has reported on public health issues in Sub-Saharan Africafor several international news organizations including the Independent and NewYork Times, says fake rumor derail public health interventions. “For example, they [people who believe these rumors] don’t go fortesting and screening. This would mean that the size of the problem can’t beknown, which affects planning for supplies and other emergency measures,” saidThomas, who also covered the Ebola outbreak in Liberia.“If many people act on such rumors, the authorities cannot plan or actto save lives. Of course, it can also be harmful or even fatal for theindividual.”While disseminating fake news and rumors impedes health interventions,it also helps spread fear and panic in the population, which cause suspected orconfirmed patients to deny their health statuses. Like in the case of the Ebola outbreak, when several patients fledisolation because they did wrongly believe a particular conspiracy theory aboutthe EVD. KnowingFacts From FictionAnother expert suggests that it is also important for Liberians to learnthe “difference between rumors and accurate information” during outbreak.“Every time you hear or read a piece of information about coronavirus,ask where does it [the information] come from? Does it come from a publichealth expert, who has experience in managing outbreaks? Does it come fromNPHIL [the National Public Health Institute of Liberia] or a medical doctor oran epidemiologist? If so, then it is likely to be accurate,” said Ida Jooste,Global Health Journalism advisor for American international NGO, Internews. “If you see your friends and neighbors spreading rumors that you believeare inaccurate, talk to them about the facts. People spread rumors because ithelps them make sense of difficult times; there is no need to get angry atthem, but you can definitely help to calmly explain to them the scientificfacts instead.”What RoleCan the Media Play?Meanwhile, expert health journalists have warned reporters against“repeating false information”, while calling on them to rather gather rumor,make assessment of them in order to determine where “the information gaps are,and then provide the accurate, credibly sourced information” to the public. Jooste, who trained dozens of Liberian journalists in health and sciencereporting during the Ebola outbreak, advisesjournalists, who have access to the internet, to frequently checkinternational websites like the US’ Center for Disease Control and the WHO toverify information about the virus. The Liberian media was recognized for its starring role in it’s effortto roll back the Ebola outbreak when it helped empowered communities withaccurate information.And Jooste says journalists still have “a big role to play during thispandemic” and they should be “careful not to sensationalize coronavirus” but“share the facts with their audiences and empower them with knowledge”.“The media should also make sure that every source they interview hastrue expertise on the subject, so they don’t accidentally risk spreadingmisinformation,” said the experienced South African journalist. “As during the Ebola time, there is a lot about this virus thatscientists still don’t know, so it’s also important to make it clear when asource is sharing an opinion versus a fact.”Added Thomas: “There is so much information out there about this newvirus and about the pandemic, yet people still have so many questions. This isto be expected when something with so much impact is so new.” She also cautioned journalists to “listen deeply and carefully to thequestions people are asking” about the virus and then seek “credible andtrusted sources who can answer the questions”.“The media may also need to translate the science into clear andeasily understood language. The media can also find well-informed influencersto amplify the messages, which will help curb the spread of the virus,” sheadded.
