"Yellow fever is a viral disease transmitted to humans by the bites of infected mosquitoes. Twenty-nine countries in Africa including   have been classified as countries at risk of Yellow fever transmission by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Yellow fever is a high-impact high-threat disease, with risk of international spread, which represents a potential threat to global health security,” the World Health Organization has said. From 1 January 2021 to 26 August 2022, a total of 12 countries in the region have reported 184 confirmed cases and 274 probable cases, including 21 deaths, reflecting ongoing complex viral transmission.   Yellow fever is caused by an arbovirus (a virus transmitted by vectors such as mosquitoes, ticks, or other arthropods) transmitted to humans by the bites of infected Aedes and Haemagogus mosquitoes. “The Aedes species are the same mosquito that spreads the Zika, Chikungunya, and Dengue viruses while the Haemogogus mosquitoes also spread yellow fever and are mostly found in the jungle.” There are three modes of transmission of the yellow fever virus.       , especially during the early stage, and has a 3 – 6 days incubation period with a wide range of symptoms and severity; Many people do not experience symptoms, but when symptoms do occur, the most common are fever, muscle pain with prominent backache, headache, loss of appetite, and nausea or vomiting. In most cases, symptoms disappear after 3–4 days. “A small percentage of patients enter a second, more toxic phase within 24 hours of recovering from initial symptoms. High fever returns and several body systems are affected, usually the liver and kidneys,” the WHO highlighted. In this phase, people are likely to develop jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes, hence the name yellow fever), dark urine, and abdominal pain with vomiting. Bleeding can occur from the mouth, nose, eyes, or stomach. Half of these patients die within 7–10 days. “ measure for preventing yellow fever,” the WHO has said.

This comes a few days after viral online claims that the country had recorded a case of MonkeyPox in Ahanta West, in the Western Region, forcing a  . “We have tested 12 suspected cases in Ghana since 24  of May. Currently, we have confirmed 5 cases in three regions –Eastern, Western, and Greater Accra. No death has occurred among the cases,” the Director-General of the Ghana Health Service, Dr Patrick Kuma-Aboagye    Monkeypox is caused by monkeypox virus, which is a viral zoonotic disease that can spread from animals to humans and from one person to the other through close contact with an infected person. Various animal species have been identified as susceptible to monkeypox virus. This includes rope squirrels, tree squirrels, Gambian pouched rats, dormice, non-human primates and other species. Human monkeypox was first identified in humans in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in a 9-month-old boy in a region where smallpox had been eliminated in 1968.   The   (interval from infection to onset of symptoms) of monkeypox is usually from 6 to 13 days but can range from 5 to 21 days. The infection can be divided into two periods: ·      The invasion period (lasts between 0–5 days) characterized by fever, intense headache, lymphadenopathy (swelling of the lymph nodes), back pain, myalgia (muscle aches) and intense asthenia (lack of energy). Lymphadenopathy is a distinctive feature of monkeypox compared to other diseases that may initially appear similar (chickenpox, measles, smallpox) ·      The skin eruption usually begins within 1–3 days of appearance of fever. The rash tends to be more concentrated on the face and extremities rather than on the trunk. It affects the face (in 95% of cases), and palms of the hands and soles of the feet (in 75% of cases). Also affected are oral mucous membranes (in 70% of cases), genitalia (30%), and conjunctivae (20%), as well as the cornea. The rash evolves sequentially from macules (lesions with a flat base) to papules (slightly raised firm lesions), vesicles (lesions filled with clear fluid), pustules (lesions filled with yellowish fluid), and crusts which dry up and fall off. The number of lesions varies from a few to several thousand. In severe cases, lesions can coalesce until large sections of skin slough off.   According to the World Health Organisation, one can reduce the risk by limiting contact with people who have suspected or confirmed monkeypox. Regularly clean your hands with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub, especially after contact with the person who is infected.   © 2022 All rights reserved","June 9, 2022",False,MONKEYPOX: Ghana confirms 5 cases in 3 regions,https://ghanafact.com/2022/06/monkeypox-ghana-confirms-5-cases-in-3-regions/

"Ghana ranked last but one in the 2019 World Bank Human Capital Index Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa False Three months to Ghana’s presidential and parliamentary elections,  the country’s two leading political parties are wooing voters and making a case as to who performs better in improving the livelihood of citizens and enhancing socio-economic development when in government. The debate between the governing New Patriotic Party (NPP) and the largest opposition party, the National Democratic Congress (NDC) has increasingly centred on the economy, education and infrastructure. Ghana’s Deputy Education Minister Dr Yaw Osei Adutwum and his predecessor Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa were both invited to argue out the achievements of their respective governments in the educational sector on one of Ghana’s leading television networks- TV3 on August 29.   A claim made on the programme that Ghana was ranked last but one in the world in the 2019 World Bank Human Capital Index (HCI) report generated discussions on social media, with users making attempts to verify the statement. This fact-check report will examine how accurate the claim is.     Mr Okudzeto Ablakwa between 1 hour 36 minutes  and 1 hour 38 minutes of the discussion said: “I am very worried when you look at the latest Human Capital Index report by the World Bank and Ghana is last but one in the world. Only Niger saved us by some two points. We probably owe a debt of gratitude to Niger, we would have been last. You look at our combined score of 44 (2019), that’s way lower than Singapore which had the highest score of 88…when you read that report which I’ve taken my time to do it draws attention to the fact that we are the focus in this country too much on enrollment”     The World Bank’s HCI measures the amount of human capital that a child born today can expect to attain by age 18. It conveys the productivity of the next generation of workers compared to a benchmark of complete education and full health across 157 countries. The HCI is made up of five indicators: the probability of survival to age five, a child’s expected years of schooling, harmonized test scores as a measure of the quality of learning, adult survival rate (fraction of 15-year olds that will survive to age 60), and the proportion of children who are not stunted. The maiden edition of the   report was published in October 2018 and subsequently captured in the  .   Mr Ablakwa claimed Ghana was “last but one” in the HCI report which sought to suggest that the country ranked 156 out of the 157 countries. But this is false because Ghana ranked 116, leaving behind 41 countries including South Africa (126) and Nigeria (152). Further, Ghana scored 0.44, and not 44 as indicated in the claim. The HCI score ranges between 0 and 1, and therefore Ghana could not have attained 44. He further alleged that Ghana was two points behind Niger that ranked last. Niger scored 0.32 to rank 155 out of 157. Niger never emerged last on the HCI chart. It was Chad that emerged last in the HCI ranking.     The   is only one of five Human Capital Index indicators and Digital news platform,   in a June 2019 article reported Ghana’s low score in the HTS, ranking last but one among 157 countries. However, Okudzeto Ablakwa mischaracterised Ghana’s ranking in the Harmonized Test Scores which is a subset of the HCI as representing our position on the Index. Ghana scored 307 in the HTS, falling short of the 391 average scores by her peers in Lower Middle-Income Countries (LMIC) bracket. But the Harmonized Test Scores ranking does not reflect the whole Human Capital Index, World Bank Program Leader for Human Development Antonio Giuffrida confirmed to GhanaFact in an email.     GhanaFact contacted the former deputy education minister and he partly said: “I did not get anything wrong. If you look at the Harmonized Test Score, assessing quality, Niger was the country that saved us from being last and that was what I was referring to. I was specifically talking about quality. I was not talking about the whole HCI, I was referring to quality at the basic level which we need to fix as a country.” This notwithstanding, GhanaFact checks from his comments on the TV3 programme as captured in this report show he did not limit his argument to HTS but rather wrongly suggested the 2019 Human Capital Index report ranked Ghana last but one in the world.     We rate the claim that Ghana was ranked last but one in the 2019 World Bank Human Capital Index report as false   © 2022 All rights reserved","September 7, 2020",False,FACT-CHECK: Okudzeto Ablakwa falsely claims Ghana was ranked last but one in World Bank HCI report,https://ghanafact.com/2020/09/fact-check-okudzeto-ablakwa-falsely-claims-ghana-was-ranked-last-but-one-in-world-bank-hci-report/

"Ghana emerged first for four consecutive years in the West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) John Dramani Mahama Exaggerated On August 26, former president and flagbearer of Ghana’s largest opposition political party, National Democratic Congress(NDC), John Mahama, introduced his running mate to the Asantehene and the Kumasi Traditional Council at Manhyia Palace in the Ashanti region. Prof. Naana Jane Opoku Agyeman, Ghana’s former education minister has been selected as the   for the December polls. The NDC flagbearer made some claims about exit examination successes registered under her stewardship as education minister when he presented her to the Asantehene, Otumfuo Osei Tutu II The programme was live-streamed on John Dramani Mahama’s verified Facebook page and has since racked up 124,000 views and 3,800 comments.   Ex-president John Mahama speaking in an indigenous Ghanaian language-Twi [between minutes 49:00 to 49:30]  said: ” If you consider the West African Senior Certificate Exams they[students] wrote recently amidst paper leakages. During her stewardship as education minister, without leakage, Ghana emerged first for four consecutive years in the West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE).”   “We [WAEC] don’t do country performance ranking. We only assess the performance of outstanding candidates and reward them.” West African Examinations Council (WAEC’s) Head of Public Relations, Agnes Teye-Cudjoe told GhanaFact in an interview. The West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) is a type of standardized test for students from the five anglophone West African nations (Nigeria, Ghana, Sierra Leone, Gambia and Liberia). Administered by the West African Examinations Council (WAEC), the exit-exam is for both certification and entry to tertiary institutions. But with the exception of subjects like Mathematics and English and a few other electives, the examination questions differ entirely among the member-states. “Some member-states have courses that others don’t have, so mostly the questions are different,” WAEC’s Head of Public Relations Agnes Teye-Cudjoe told GhanaFact in an interview. Despite the difference, students with the highest total score from across the exam union are recognized in the WAEC International Excellence Awards for their outstanding performance each year.   GhanaFact checks show between 2013 and 2016, Ghanaian students have been awarded consecutively at the West African Senior Secondary Certificate Examination (WASSCE) Distinction Awards by   ( ,  ,   and  ). GhanaFact rates the claim that Ghana emerged first for four consecutive years in WASSCE as an exaggeration. Our independent checks from the website of organisers of WASSCE, interviews with Civil Society and officials of WAEC show the council does not publish a country performance ranking as being suggested by the former president.

" Video shows a young man shot in the mouth at Ejura Twitter user   #DampareMustGo has been trending on Twitter in Ghana over the last 48 hours, as some social media users demand for the dismissal of the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Dr George Akuffo Dampare. This follows an alleged extra-judicial killing of a suspect, Albert Akwasi Donkor in Nkoranza, a community in the Bono East Region while in police custody.   As part of the heated online conversation,  a video showing   is being widely circulated on   and portrayed as a shooting incident involving the police which happened in Ejura, in the Ashanti Region sometime last year – to feed the perception of callous police crowd-control strategy under the current leadership of the security agency. The 12-second video was shared on May 18, 2022, with the caption “look at what Stray Bullets from the Police at Ejura did to the young man going to get food yet no one was held accountable #DampareMustGo.” The video has so far been viewed close to thirty thousand times, retweeted more than 150 times and liked close to 400 times, while the discussions around #DampareMustGo have potentially reached more than 17 million people, according to Talkwalker – a Consumer Intelligence Acceleration platform. This fact-check report sought to verify the accuracy of the Twitter post relating to the video.   A simple online search by GhanaFact showed that the incident did not happen in Ejura as captioned in the Tweet. The young man seen in the video is now-deceased-18-year-old, Abdul Hakim Yakubu, who was hit by a stray bullet in Lamashegu in Tamale, in the Northern region of Ghana. , was during a clash between some disgruntled residents of Lamashegu and the police, following a misunderstanding between a driver and a police patrol team. The driver who failed to heed calls by the police to stop was given a hot chase and shot at, as he drove to the Lamashegu chief’s palace for refuge. This infuriated the youth in the area, who reportedly pelted stones at the police and burnt lorry tires on the streets. During the standoff, 18-year-old, Abdul Hakim Yakubu was hit by a stray bullet and declared dead on arrival at the Tamale Teaching Hospital, while 8 others were injured.

" Vladimir Putin rubbishes Kenyan U.N. Ambassador’s remarks against Russia’s moves in Ukraine  Enoch Bett Has President Vladimir Putin rebuked Kenya’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations (UN), Dr Martin Kimani following his remarks at the UN Security Council against Russia’s moves in Ukraine? A viral screenshot of an article claims the Russian President has said: “ End Starvation in your country before lecturing us on international dispute,” apparently in direct response to Kenya. The screenshot has since been widely circulated on Twitter in Ghana ( ), Nigeria ( ) and Kenya ( ).     This fact-check report will seek to verify:   Kenyan U.N. Ambassador,   in a speech at the United Nations Security Council(UNSC) warned the Russian leader that his failure to pursue diplomacy in the conflict with Ukraine was unjustifiable and a sure recipe for disaster. During an emergency meeting of the UNSC to debate Russia’s move to recognize the independence of two breakaway regions in Ukraine and to deploy “peacekeepers” there, the Kenyan envoy’s remarks ( ) have been widely praised. “We meet tonight on the brink of a major conflict in Ukraine. The diplomacy we urged 17th of February is failing. The territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine stand breached. The charter of the United Nations continues to wilt under the relentless assault of the powerful. In one moment, it is invoked with reference by the very same countries who turn their backs on it in pursuit of objectives diametrically opposed to international peace and security,” he partly said.   A google search of the exact phrase on the viral screenshot led GhanaFact to an article titled “Vladimir Putin to Kenya: End starvation in your country before lecturing us on international disputes” published on an online publishing platform,   and authored by Enoch Bett. The name, Enoch Bett is also conspicuously displayed on the viral screenshot. According to the  , President Putin in an exclusive interview said: “I was not going to respond to that third-world country, but I have only this to say. Kenya should concentrate on ending starvation that continues to bedevil it instead of trying to talk about things they do not understand. Kenya doesn’t know anything about international disputes, focus on the things that matter to you.” GhanaFact after conducting a google search of key parts of the article and quotes attributed to President Putin found no other credible news platform had reported the story. So, we reached out to the Kenyan journalist Enoch Bett to assist us with the source of the claims made in the article and in his response said it was “a made-up article.” In a statement subsequently posted on  , he said: “I would like to apologize to all users for the high-impact fake news that I have created on Putin responding to Kenya.

"Drop in number of candidates for WASSCE 2020 Dr Clement Apaak False The campaign season is heating up and Ghanaians are gearing up for the upcoming December polls. The easing of various restrictions introduced at the onset of the coronavirus outbreak has led to a bit of shift in public discussion from the pandemic, allowing politicians to step up their campaign efforts to win over the electorates with messages on traditional and social media. Final year students in senior high schools across the country have started their West African Senior School Certificate Exams (WASSCE) as part of government measures announced earlier to ease students back into classrooms, despite some opposition. The WASSCE candidates who are beneficiaries of the government’s free senior high school policy have been dominating the news, with a ranking member on the Education Committee in Parliament Dr Clement Apaak claiming there has been a decline in the total number of candidates expected to write WASSCE 2020 notwithstanding the social intervention programme. But how true is the claim being made by the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) MP?   In a Facebook post on July 19, the legislator representing the Builsa South Constituency Dr Clement Apaak claimed there was a “drop in number of candidates for WASSCE 2020.” The Facebook post has since been republished by several online platforms,  ,  ,   and  .   GhanaFact checks show the Facebook post of Dr Clement Apaak has at least been edited once and while previously there was no reference to where he sourced the total number of 2020 WASSCE candidates used in his analysis from, subsequent edits pointed fingers at President Nana Akufo-Addo. An independent verification of the changes can be seen by viewing the edit history of Dr Clement Apaak’s Facebook post and here is part of the changes to his original post: “The President has quoted 313, 837 on at least two occasions as the number of candidates for WASSCE 2020.”   GhanaFact in an earlier   flagged as false a tweet by the President claiming the total number of 2020 WASSCE candidates is 313, 837. The Deputy Minister of Education Dr Yaw Osei Adutwum in an interview on Citi TV’s Point of View programme on July 20 conceded that a “mistake was made.”   GhanaFact checks on the website of the organisers of WASSCE,   show the total number of SHS students taking the exams this year is 375,737 and not the figure used by Dr Clement Apaak in his analysis. So, the legislator’s claim that “between 2019 and 2020 there is a drop in the number of candidates by -32,257” is false.   Since the implementation of the free senior high school program in 2017, there has been a yearly increase in the number of WASSCE candidates in Ghana according to data from the West African Examinations Council(WAEC).   GhanaFact rates as false the claim that there has been a decline in the total number of candidates expected to write 2020 WASSCE compared to the year before.   In an interview with GhanaFact, the Builsa South Member of Parliament Dr Clement Apaak said: “My claim was based on what government churned-out… If government has conceded, I will also concede.” However, he lamented how the government has been misleading the public due to the conflicting figures. “I am not the problem, government is the problem. The point I’m seeking to make is that government and the presidency in making this mistake must be held accountable and asked questions. How can you have a whole ministry with so many ministers, GES, the presidency and they could not have gotten the figures right? That should be something worrying to Ghanaians. For the President to have quoted that figure, not once, not twice but severally.” GhanaFact is monitoring the MP’s Facebook page and will duly update this fact-check report if he effects the necessary corrections to his post.   © 2022 All rights reserved","July 21, 2020",False,"FACT-CHECK: NDC MP, Dr Apaak falsely claims number of 2020 WASSCE candidates has dropped",https://ghanafact.com/2020/07/fact-check-ndc-mp-dr-apaak-falsely-claims-number-of-2020-wassce-candidates-has-dropped/

The Greater Accra Region has consistently had the lowest poverty headcount since 2005/06. In 2016/17 the poverty incidence of 2.5 percent in the Greater Accra Region was about 21 percentage points lower than the national average. On the other hand, the incidence of poverty in the Northern, Upper East, and Upper West Regions have been consistently higher than the national average since 2005/06. The average poverty incidence for the three regions stands at 62.26%. “The next survey will study the dynamics of poverty in the northern part of the country to help government address the inequalities,” Head of Statistics at the GSS, Anthony Krakah told GhanaFact in an interview.   The claim that the poverty rate in the Northern part of Ghana is worse compared to Accra is partly true even though the percentage rates used are understated.     © 2022 All rights reserved","December 22, 2020",False,Fact-checking claims about Ghana’s economy and poverty levels published by France 24,https://ghanafact.com/2020/12/fact-checking-claims-about-ghanas-economy-and-poverty-levels-published-by-france-24/

The claim has since been mainstreamed by multiple local and international media organizations ( ,  ,  ,   and  ).   A contraction in an economy simply means it has recorded negative growth, which occurs when the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) reduces year over year. Gross Domestic Product is the estimate of the total value of final goods and services produced in the country over a given period.   The 3.2 percent contraction in Ghana’s economy recorded in the   is the first time in four years and not 37 years as suggested by Government Statistician, Samuel Kobina Annim. GhanaFact checks show it is the first economic contraction since the   when Ghana recorded a negative growth of 0.1%, according to data from the Ghana Statistical Service ( ). Even before that, Ghana recorded similar contractions in the   and the  , with negative 1.6% and negative 1.0% growth respectively. “So, this should not be the first time in 37 years that the economy is contracting. However, this should be the first time in 37 years that the economy is contracting by this magnitude,” A Senior Economist at Databank Group, Courage Martey said in an interview with GhanaFact.   “On an annual basis, if you take the annual GDP it is after 37 years. But nowhere in our report have we indicated that after 37 years we are recording a negative GDP. It is not even in our report. So, even though the Government Statistician might have said it, he was referring to the annual GDP. So if you are using our report which we have published, then the last time we contracted on a quarterly basis as you indicated was 2016 quarter two, per our report,” Head of Statistics at the Ghana Statistical Service(GSS), Francis Mensah said in an interview with GhanaFact after we engaged him on our findings. However, the defence being put up by the National Statistical Office of Ghana is curious because it will be misleading to compare annual GDP figures with quarterly estimates as is being suggested. “We haven’t yet seen the annual growth rate for 2020 because we have two more quarters to go, so we cannot be comparing the second quarter with an annual figure. The economy expanded by 4.9% in the first quarter of 2020 and contracted by 3.2% year-on-year in the second quarter. But even if we annualize the first half 2020 performance for purposes of comparing annual growth rates, I’m not sure we would obtain an annualized contraction for full year 2020.” Courage Martey clarified.   The claim that Ghana’s economy has contracted for the first time in 37 years after recording a negative 3.2 percent growth in the second quarter of this year is false.   © 2022 All rights reserved","September 18, 2020",False,FACT-CHECK: Ghana Statistical Service wrongly claims Ghana’s economy has contracted for the first time in 37 years,https://ghanafact.com/2020/09/fact-check-ghana-statistical-service-wrongly-claims-ghanas-economy-has-contracted-for-the-first-time-in-37-years/
": WASSCE candidates increased more under the NDC administration than the current NPP government Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa : False A Facebook post by a former Deputy Education Minister, Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa has stoked controversy on social media about the achievements of ex-president John Mahama’s administration in the educational sector compared to President Nana Akufo-Addo’s government. According to the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) Member of Parliament (MP), the number of WASSCE candidates increased more under the previous NDC administration than the current New Patriotic Party (NPP) government. While sending well wishes to the final year senior high school students currently sitting their exams, the legislator representing the North Tongu constituency also presented an analysis of the number of WASSCE candidates between 2012 and 2020 and concluded that: “In four years – President Mahama increased WASSCE candidates by 99,801 while President Akufo-Addo has increased same by only 39,575.” His post has since generated more than 2,000 Facebook engagements, with the post being shared 281 times and generated 779 comments at the time of writing this report. So, how true is this claim?   The NDC was in government by June 2016 when WASSCE candidates took their exams, so why did the MP use 2016 figures in calculating the performance of the current government. Also, if we want to examine the effects of the Free Senior High School(SHS) policy, we can only do so starting from 2017 when it was introduced and not 2016. Mr Okudzeto Ablakwa in analysing the data also claimed the number of WASSCE candidates for 2020 was 313,837 which is inaccurate because the correct figure provided by the West African Examinations Council (WAEC) is 375,737. The legislator in an interview on Citi TV’s Point of View programme on July 20 said: “I’m willing to concede that,” when questioned about the wrong 2020 WASSCE candidates number used in making his analysis, which by extension impacts his conclusion. However, GhanaFact checks show the NDC MP is yet to effect the necessary corrections on his Facebook post at the time of writing this report.     The metric used by the NDC MP, that is comparing the differences between 2012 and 2016 WASSCE candidates against 2016 and 2020 WASSCE candidates is problematic because it might not offer a nuanced statistical generalisation. By subtracting the 2012 figure from 2016 and 2016 from 2020, as the basis for his analysis, he ignores key dimensions such as the yearly improvements, the consistency with enrollment within the years under discussion, the rise or decline in enrollment within these years, the year that recorded the highest numbers and why, among others.   Notwithstanding the concerns noted, we still compared the number of WASSCE candidates during the NDC  and NPP administrations as argued by Okudzeto Ablakwa.         Going by the MP’s calculation: , we have 274,263 – 174,385 =       we have 375,737 – 274,263 =    Data sourced from the organisers of WASSCE, West African Examinations Council (WAEC) does not support the claims made by the NDC MP Okudzeto Ablakwa that: “President Mahama increased WASSCE candidates by 99,801 while President Akufo-Addo has increased same by only 39,575.” GhanaFact checks, using the same data source and metric by the legislator showed WASSCE candidates increased by 101,474 under the current NPP government as compared to the 99,878 under the NDC administration. So, the claim by the former Deputy Education Minister that WASSCE candidates increased more under the NDC administration than the current NPP government is false.   The period 2012 to 2016 should be considered as 6 academic years because 2-year groups (form 4 and form 3) wrote the exam in the same year(2013). On the other hand, the period 2016 to 2020 is made of 5 academic years which genuinely wouldn’t allow for a fair comparison. Policy actors should note that measuring the real impact of the Free SHS should not be limited to the number of WASSCE candidates or enrollment. The government and policy actors have always used the increased enrollment as a major metric to show improvement which is reflected in Ghana’s 2019  Measuring outcome based on enrollment/ number of WASSCE candidates might not always work because of inconsistent data, population dynamics and other social factors. The NDC MP’s analysis is not consistent with   and   that leverage the Gross Enrollment Ratio, Net Enrollment Ratio, Net Completion Rate and Baseline Data. The government should not hastefully use numbers to justify the impact of Free SHS, rather a fair assessment can be done through a thorough evaluation using 3 successive years of completion of Free SHS. When the government relies solely on enrollment as a metric to show the success of Free SHS, that could be deceptive. Data from   reveal that although in 2018, exactly one year after the Free SHS, Ghana achieved secondary school gross enrollment ratio of 71.32% ( the highest in our history since 1979) and 5th in Africa ( only Egypt, Mauritius, Morocco and Tunisia) performed better than Ghana in Africa, in 2019, there was a very sharp decline in the secondary school Gross Enrollment from 71.32% to 64.572%. Free SHS alone cannot augment enrollment at the Senior High School level when primary and Junior High School(JHS) enrollment keep declining. To increase enrollment, policymakers should look at the inputs at the primary and JHS levels because they rather produce students for the Senior High schools.   There should be at least 4 key indicators used in measuring the impact of Free SHS: © 2022 All rights reserved","July 22, 2020",False,"FACT-CHECK: NDC MP, Okudzeto Ablakwa falsely claims WASSCE candidates increased more under the NDC administration than the current NPP government",https://ghanafact.com/2020/07/fact-check-ndc-mp-okudzeto-ablakwa-falsely-claims-wassce-candidates-increased-more-under-the-ndc-administration-than-the-current-npp-government/
"An image showing two GH¢100 banknotes is being passed around on WhatsApp with a caution to the general public to look out for the Adinkra symbol- “Dwennimmen” if one wants to make out counterfeits.

The upper part has a three-dimensional image of an Adinkra symbol moving above an apparently deep background: the symbol of ‘STRENGTH’ on the GH¢100, and ‘EXCEPT GOD’ symbol on the GH¢200. The lower part of the stripe features the parliamentary mace on the GH¢100 and the state sword on the GH¢200. When tilted these images appear to move.   Shiny colour changing images of the Adinkra symbols: ‘STRENGTH’ on the GH¢100 and ‘EXCEPT GOD’ on the GH¢200.

The colour changes from Gold to Green when tilted.   It is the image of Tetteh Quarshie with a cocoa pod, more noticeable in the plain star area of the banknote. It becomes visible on both sides when viewed against light. The denomination value can also be seen in the watermark.   It is a golden band with gold bars at the back of the banknote, running from top to bottom. It can be seen more clearly when the note is tilted.     The circulation of banknotes is the responsibility of the Bank of Ghana.

The “fake” screenshot which comes with a picture of the Rwandan President is being circulated on WhatsApp and   to suggest Paul Kagame has expressed some misgivings about the Ghanaian government’s decision to invest in drone delivery of medical supplies. “And by this I am not saying my country is the best or I am the best president in Africa but for a country that lacks common ambulances and rather spending on expensive drones is just an inexcusable corrupt means of draining the country’s money.

We will continue to ensure that the needed funds are provided to ensure a successful implementation.” The Minister confirmed at a recent forum.   The Ghana 2021 Population and Housing Census (PHC) will consist of a population census and a housing census as one operation. A Population Census is the official enumeration of all persons in a country at a specified time.

A Housing Census is the official enumeration of all living quarters (occupied and vacant) in a country at a specified time. This enumeration also implies the collection, compilation, evaluation, analysis, publication, and dissemination of statistical data pertaining to these living quarters and the occupants. Ghana has conducted five post-independent population censuses in 1960, 1970, 1984, 2000 and 2010. “The last two consists of a population census and a housing census, making the 2021 PHC the third Population and housing census conducted in Ghana,” the   has stated.   The midnight of June 27 will be the Census Night which according to the Ghana Statistical Service is the reference date for census enumeration and all questions asked during enumeration will relate to that Night. “Everyone must take note of the census night date and remember to answer the questions accurately during enumeration.

This fact-check report seeks to verify the accuracy of the claim.   The   is an international organization that engages with business, political, academic and other leaders of society to shape global, regional and industry agendas. The forum publishes benchmark global reports on Competitiveness, Gender, and Risk. The Global Competitiveness Report (GCR) series, first launched in 1979, is a yearly report published by the World Economic Forum which features the Global Competitiveness Index (GCI). The GCI measures the set of institutions, policies, and factors that determine the level of productivity of a country, which is based on 12 pillars of competitiveness. In 2020, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic meant the long-standing Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) rankings was paused and instead, a   was published dedicated to elaborating on the priorities for economic recovery and revival and considering the building blocks of a transformation towards new economic systems that combine “productivity”, “people” and “planet” targets. , measuring only those priorities for economic transformation rather than the complete set of factors needed to drive productivity, sustainability and shared prosperity. To assess the claim therefore GhanaFact referred to the World Economic Forum’s  . After assessing the performance of 11 out of 16 countries in the sub-region captured in the document, nowhere does it say or conclude that “Ghana has the best road networks in West Africa.” To understand what the 2019 Global Competitiveness Report said about Ghana, we scrutinized the country’s performance under the infrastructure pillar, which is one of 12 used for the Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) rankings. We then probed the 12 subareas under the infrastructure pillar which include road connectivity and quality of road infrastructure. (Rank/141)     Based on the World Economic Forum (WEF) ranking of road connectivity across 141 economies, Ghana ranked 79th, which when compared with the other 9 West African countries ranked in the report puts Ghana at 6th in the sub-region. This makes the claim that “Ghana has the best road networks in West Africa,”    Another sub-metric ranked in the Global Competitiveness Report is the quality of road infrastructure, which Ghana emerged 118 out of 141 economies assessed. This ranking when compared with the performance of 10 other West African countries mentioned in the report puts Ghana at 8th in the sub-region.       Five   including Guinea Bissau, Liberia, Niger, Sierra Leone and Togo were not featured in the 2019 Global Competitiveness Report.   The claim that the World Economic Forum (WEF) has ranked Ghana as having the best road infrastructure is FALSE.       © 2022 All rights reserved","March 22, 2021",False,FACT-CHECK: Ghana has the best road networks in West Africa?,https://ghanafact.com/2021/03/fact-check-ghana-has-the-best-road-networks-in-west-africa/

" 8 out of 10 people who have got HIV/AIDS in Ghana pick it through gay or bisexual activity  Moses Foh-Amoaning Discussions about Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and intersex (LGBTQI) rights in Ghana have been thrown into the national spotlight, with many polarizing opinions dominating conversations on traditional and social media. This comes after a new draft law currently being considered by the legislature seeks to tighten restrictions on the activities of the LGBTQI community and further criminalise support for the group. In a recent interview on one of Ghana’s leading TV networks – TV3, a known critic of the LGBTQI community, lawyer Moses Foh-Amoaning said: “8 out of 10 people who have got HIV/AIDS in Ghana, pick it through gay or bisexual activity. That is a fact. Go to the Ghana AIDS Commission, they will tell you. So, it is the vector for the transmission of AIDS.”  has since been   a 30-second-long video clip posted on Twitter showing the anti-LGBTQI campaigner making the claim, with human rights organization, Rightify Ghana calling on us to verify its accuracy. Again, the Executive Secretary of Ghana’s homophobic Coalition, Moses Foh-Amoaning weaponised incorrect HIV data to promote their anti-LGBTQ bill. According to him, 8 out of 10 HIV cases in Ghana are gays and bisexuals           — Rightify Ghana (@RightifyGhana)  By the end of 2015, there were  , with women constituting about 60%. The country recorded total annual AIDS deaths of 10,958 in the same year, according to the  . However, the latest figures from the   show the country currently has 342,307 Persons Living with HIV. So, for the claim made by Moses Foh-Amoaning to be true, then 80% of the current number (273,845) got infected with HIV through gay or bisexual activity. But where is the proof? A report by the Ghana Aids Commission –   has explored behavioural risk factors that contribute to the HIV vulnerability of men who have sex with men (MSM) in Ghana among other objectives. The overall size estimate of men who have sex with men (MSM) in Ghana is 54,759, according to the largest integrated bio-behavioural surveillance survey (IBBSS) to be conducted among MSM in Ghana. The GMS II found an aggregate national HIV prevalence of 18.1% amongst MSM in Ghana. This will translate to some 9,911 people of the total estimated number of men who have sex with men (MSM) in Ghana. “When we take the mode of transmission[HIV], 80% of transmission occurs through sex, being it heterosexual or homosexual, 15% is mother to child and 5% happens through blood transfusion and sharp objects,” Programme Manager at the National AIDS/STI Control Programme at the Ghana Health Service(GHS), Dr Stephen Ayisi Addo told GhanaFact. So, it is therefore inaccurate to claim that 8 out of 10 people who have got HIV/AIDS in Ghana pick it through gay or bisexual activity. According to Dr Stephen Ayisi Addo “it is also not true that if you take a 10 of people living with HIV, 8 of them are bisexual and men who have sex with men. It’s wrong.” Meanwhile, men who have sex with men (MSM) in all study regions (Ashanti, Eastern, Volta, Central, and Brong-Ahafo, Greater Accra, Northern and Western regions) are disproportionately affected by HIV, the   report concluded.     The   has also revealed that HIV prevalence amongst key populations, such as men who have sex with men (MSM), female sex workers (FSWs), persons who inject drugs (PWIDs) and prisoners is disproportionately high compared to the general population: five times higher among FSWs and more than eight times higher among MSM (GAC, 2016). “In 2014, heterosexuals contributed 72% which means that HIV transmission is happening more in the normal, and men who have sex with-men is 5.4% and Female Sex Worker contribute 18.5%. Why is it so? When you take the prevalence of HIV among Men who have sex with Men is 18 % and yet their contribution to the total population of people living with HIV, it’s 5.4% and that is because they are few in terms of numbers but they are also contributing,” Dr Stephen Ayisi Addo explained. When GhanaFact contacted lawyer Moses Foh-Amoaning about the findings of this report, he defended his earlier statement but failed to provide the source of his claim. “You are just an agency set up by the LGBTQI community and benefitting from them,” he further falsely claimed. The claim that 8 out of 10 people who have got HIV/AIDS in Ghana pick it through gay or bisexual activity is  .  Available data also shows that it is inaccurate to suggest 80% of Persons Living with HIV in Ghana are from the LGBTQI community.                   © 2022 All rights reserved","August 24, 2021",False,FALSE: 80% of people living with HIV in Ghana pick it through gay or bisexual activity,https://ghanafact.com/2021/08/false-80-of-people-living-with-hiv-in-ghana-pick-it-through-gay-or-bisexual-activity/

"Four claims about how economic indicators are performing better under the NPP than the former NDC government Dr Mahamudu Bawumia : Four claims assessed are true Vice President Dr Mahamudu Bawumia has made multiple claims about the economic achievements of the current government as compared to the former and made a case why Ghanaians should re-elect President Nana Akufo-Addo during the upcoming December elections. In a Facebook post on July 28, he listed “50 achievements” of the current administration and said: “On the basis of the performance record, the leadership of this country by Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo has resulted in much better outcomes than the disastrous outcomes under the leadership of John Mahama.” The post has since generated close to 7,300 Facebook engagements, including 1,300 comments and 1,200 shares and was leading the trends on twitter in Ghana, at a point last night. This fact-check report will assess the accuracy of 4 claims made by the Vice President.     According to Dr Mahamudu Bawumia: “John Mahama presided over a decline in economic growth for his four years in office while Nana Akufo-Addo has presided over higher economic growth in his first three years in office before the COVID-19 pandemic.” Here, we will look at the GDP growth rates in the first three years of Former President John Mahama’s government, strike the average rate and compare with the same period under President Nana Akufo-Addo. Since the year has not yet ended, we will not consider 2020 in this analysis and to ensure fairness, the 2016 growth rate figure of 3.4% will also be omitted in scrutinizing the performance of the previous government. Former President John Mahama ( President Nana Akufo-Addo  Comparatively the NPP administration under President Nana Akufo-Addo has performed better than the previous government when using the GDP growth rate as an indicator, so the claim is true.   According to Dr Mahamudu Bawumia: “John Mahama presided over a decline in agriculture. Nana Akufo-Addo increased agricultural output and Ghana is currently exporting many food items as a result of the planting for food and jobs initiative.” To assess this claim, we will look at the Agriculture sector growth rate during the former government and compare to the performance of the sector in the current administration. To ensure a fair assessment of the two governments, we will have to leave out the last years of their respective tenures including 2016 and 2020. Former President John Mahama ( President Nana Akufo-Addo  After striking a three-year average of the growth rates recorded in the Agricultural sector under the NDC and NPP, it is true that the current government has performed better than the previous administration. Ghana has increased exports of food items to neighbouring countries from 85,000 MT to 133,145 MT between 2017 and 2019, Finance Minister Ken Ofori-Attah disclosed in the   and pointed at government’s Planting for Food and Jobs initiative for the improvement. However, it should be noted that between 2017 and 2019, Agricultural sector growth has declined consistently.   According to Dr Mahamudu Bawumia: “John Mahama presided over low industrial growth during his four years in office. Nana Akufo-Addo has increased industrial growth and building and reviving many factories under IDIF, etc..” Former President John Mahama ( President Nana Akufo-Addo  The current government has averagely performed better in three years compared to the same period under the former administration. So, the claim is true. According to Dr Mahamudu Bawumia: “John Mahama presided over higher inflation. Nana Akufo-Addo has reduced inflation.” Former President John Mahama ( President Nana Akufo-Addo  The average inflation rate in the first three years of the current government is better than what pertained during a similar period under the former government.

"Ghanaian farmers have stopped shipping cocoa beans to Europe Twitter Is it true that Ghanaian farmers have officially stopped shipping cocoa beans to Europe? Various social media users( ,   and  ) are suggesting cocoa farmers from the West African nation will stop shipping cocoa beans to Europe because they are underpaid and overworked. “They only earn $ 2billion out of the $ 102 billion trade in chocolate,” one tweet said. On YouTube, a video captioned:   references the country’s President Nana Akufo-Addo as the source of the claim.     Ghana is the  , with the industry highly regulated by the state through the industry regulator-  . All cocoa beans in Ghana are sold to Licensed Buying Companies (LBCs) which in turn sell to the only exporter in Ghana, the COCOBOD or to domestic industries for local processing.  The main export destinations over the years have been: European Union, Japan and the United States. Thus, individual cocoa farmers in Ghana do not have the authority to stop shipping cocoa beans to Europe as claimed in the widely shared Tweet. In 2020, Ghana secured a   for cocoa purchases in the 2020/21 season and the country’s cocoa industry regulator Cocoa Board (COCOBOD) signed the export-finance agreement. Hence, it can not be true that Ghanaian cocoa farmers have stopped shipping cocoa beans to Europe. Meanwhile, a Senior Public Affairs Manager at the  , Fifii Boafo, has dismissed the claim as false and suggested some comments by Ghana’s President were being misconstrued. “That is not the case. What the President has said is that going forward, Ghana seeks to process its cocoa beans locally to add value instead of shipping the raw beans,” he told GhanaFact. “Ghana no longer wants to be dependent on the production and export of raw materials including cocoa beans. We intend to process more and more of our cocoa in our country with the aim of producing more chocolates ourselves because we believe that there can be no future prosperity for the Ghanaian people in the short, medium or long term if we continue to maintain economic structures that are dependent on the production and export of raw material.” Ghana’s President Nana Akufo-Addo said at the Federal Assembly of the Swiss Confederation, in Bern, Switzerland on February 28, 2021. However, according to COCOBOD, this did not mean Ghana was immediately stopping the exportation of cocoa beans. “It’s the medium-term target but not a statement categorically that Cocoa will not be shipped henceforth.” As of June 3, 2021, Ghanaian farmers have harvested  , compared with a target of   that ends in September.   The claim is  © 2022 All rights reserved","July 6, 2021",False,FALSE: Ghana has NOT stopped shipping cocoa beans to Europe,https://ghanafact.com/2021/07/3446/
"2016 GDP growth rate is the lowest in the fourth republic  Gabby Asare Otchere-Darko False In a very much anticipated interview on Citi TV, a leading member of the governing New Patriotic Party (NPP) Gabby Asare Otchere-Darko, has claimed Ghana’s GDP growth rate in 2016 is the lowest in the fourth republic. The about 1-hour long interview on Citi TV’s Face to Face programme, saw the NPP stalwart make a number of other claims that sort to pooh-pooh the record of the previous National Democratic Congress (NDC) government. As part of the wide-ranging encounter with Journalist, Umaru Sanda Amadu, the Senior Partner of Law Firm, Africa Legal Associates touted the achievements of the current administration and suggested they stood a good chance of being re-elected in the December polls. But how true is the claim that the 2016 GDP growth rate is the lowest in the fourth republic? Mr Otchere-Darko, between minutes 22:57 and 23:08 said: “2016 was 3.4% GDP growth. And you know what that meant? It was the lowest GDP growth for the whole of the fourth republic.”    was birthed on January 7, 1993, when the country’s 1992 Constitution came into effect after a chequered history of military interventions. So, to be able to assess the comment, one must look out for the GDP growth rate between 1993 and 2019 but bear in mind that the Ghana Statistical Service has rebased Ghana’s economic calculations in 2010 and 2018. “The figures will naturally have to be rebased if you want to compare…[But] whether you rebase or not the relative change is going to be the same.” A Senior Lecturer at the University of Ghana Economics Department Dr Ebo Turkson said in an interview with GhanaFact. That notwithstanding our checks from World Bank computation [using constant 2010 U.S. dollars] found that Ghana’s 2015 growth rate of 2.17% is the lowest in the fourth republic. “2015 was the year we did worse and not 2016. That was the year we went to the IMF.” Dr Ebo Turkson reiterated. Attempts to reach Gabby Asare Otchere-Darko for a reaction following our findings proved futile.

": Government presents inconsistent Free SHS data Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa : True A former Deputy Education Minister, Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa has pointed out inconsistencies in government’s data on the flagship Free Senior High School programme. In a Facebook post on July 24, the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) Member of Parliament (MP) said:  “Same Mid-Year Review document delivered in Parliament yesterday: Page 44 informs us that Form 3 students are 362,108; page 97 paragraph 468, on the other hand, presents a different figure of 313,837. That’s a variance of 48,271.”   According to the legislator representing the North Tongu constituency, there is the need for an independent audit of all the numbers to ensure taxpayers are getting value from the GH¢3.2 billion invested in the educational programme.

According to the 2019 review budget, Page 47 paragraph 214, 362,108 students were admitted in September 2017. But this contradicts the 2018 review budget which claims 362,118 first-year students from all public SHS are benefiting from the programme. ( Page 36 paragraph number 163).   Data from WAEC shows that in 2020, there were 313,838 public-funded students who are writing the WASSCE, while another set of 61,927 candidates are coming from private institutions who are not funded under the free SHS programme. In all, 375,765 students are sitting for the 2020 WASSCE.   Meanwhile, government is yet to account for the difference of 48,270.

"Do you know that pregnant women and children aged 15 and above can now be vaccinated in Ghana? The Ghana Health Service (GHS) and the Ministry of Health (MoH), at a press briefing on January 19, 2022, confirmed that   could now take the vaccine – after a similar decision involving children was taken in November 2021 –  to help in efforts to defeat the virus. “Pregnant women who are unvaccinated can now be vaccinated. Previously, it was not policy to vaccinate and now they can vaccinate and they recommended that we use either Moderna or Pfizer which is the mRNA’S technology to vaccinate them,”  , Dr Patrick Kuma-Aboagye said. Ghana’s multiphased COVID-19 vaccination programme started in March 2021, when frontline health workers and other categories of persons at high risk were prioritised. 
 The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has been approved for children aged 15 and above by the Food and Drugs Authority (FDA) and the Ghana Health Service (GHS). The   has subsequently confirmed that the vaccination efforts would be extended to various schools to ensure children who fall within the age bracket are inoculated. “We are by this letter requesting all regional and District Directors of Education to work closely with their colleague Regional and District Directors of Health to Facilitate the vaccination of all 15 years or older in all schools across the country,”   on November 18, 2021, has said. Meanwhile, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized emergency use of the   COVID-19 vaccine for children 5 through 11 years of age. The Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) is supported by clinical data after showing a favourable safety profile and high vaccine efficacy of  % in children 5 through 11 years of age during a period when Delta was the prevalent strain. 
 The   has also announced the country’s readiness to begin administering booster doses to persons who are fully vaccinated six months apart from the date they received the second dose. Persons eligible for the booster dose include health workers, persons with underlying medical conditions, persons 60 years and above, frontline security personnel, members of the executive, judiciary and legislature. 
 Ghana has seen a sharp rise in its COVID-19 cases in December amidst the spread of the Omicron variant which was   on November 21, 2021.

"Ghana is one of over 50 countries worldwide where an influence operation (IO) – coordinated efforts to manipulate or corrupt public debate for a strategic goal – has been identified and removed by Facebook. According to the social media company, over 150 networks were busted across these countries for violating its policy against Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior (“CIB”) which relates to any coordinated network of accounts, Pages and Groups that centrally rely on fake accounts to mislead Facebook and people using its services about who is behind the operation and what they are doing. This is captured in a newly released report by Facebook- “ ”   According to the popular social media platform, threat actors have since 2017 continued to evolve their techniques to evade detection. This was observed in the Ghana operation where individuals associated with the Russian Internet Research Agency (IRA) recruited locals to focus their posts on Facebook on racial equality issues in the US and attempted to run political ads, including by co-opting people in the US to do so ahead of the country’s 2020 elections. The campaign relied heavily on authentic accounts and off-platform coordination, including setting up an office in Accra for a fictitious NGO. “They assessed that the operation outsourced this activity in an effort to appear more credible and authentic, minimize language discrepancies, and frustrate our ability to attribute,” Facebook stated in its May 2021 report. According to Facebook, the investigation started internally but evolved into a collaboration with  and Twitter to help in understanding the on-the-ground operations behind the network. “We removed 49 Facebook accounts, 69 Pages and 85 Instagram accounts for engaging in foreign interference — which is coordinated inauthentic behaviour on behalf of a foreign actor — on Facebook, Instagram and other internet platforms. This network was in the early stages of building an audience and was operated by local nationals — some wittingly and some unwittingly — in Ghana and Nigeria on behalf of individuals in Russia.” Facebook’s Head of Security Policy, Nathaniel Gleicher stated in a   in March 2020. “We disrupted it before it could gain a meaningful following in the US.”   has emphasized.   Here are the key trends and tactics involving influence operations (IO) observed by Facebook:   Influence operations target multiple platforms, and there are specific steps that the defender community, including platforms like Facebook, can take to make IO less effective, easier to detect, and more costly for adversaries. There is the need to combine automated detection and expert investigations. Because expert investigations are hard to scale, it’s important to combine them with automated detection systems that catch known inauthentic behaviours and threat actors. This in turn allows investigators to focus on the most sophisticated adversaries and emerging risks coming from yet unknown actors. In addition to stopping specific operations, platforms should keep improving their defences to make the tactics that threat actors rely on less effective: for example, by improving automated detection of fake accounts. “As part of this effort, platforms can incorporate lessons from CIB disruptions back into their products, and run red team exercises to better understand the evolution of the threat and prepare for highly-targeted civic events like elections.” The   said. Independent researchers, law enforcement and journalists would also have to work together to better counter IO because they rarely are confined to one medium. Influence operations are not new, but over the past several years they have burst into global public consciousness. These campaigns attempt to undermine trust in civic institutions and corrupt public debate by exploiting the same digital tools that have diversified the online public square and empowered critical discussions from Me Too to the Black Lives Matter movements. © 2022 All rights reserved","June 1, 2021",False,Facebook report details how a Russia-linked troll farm was set up in Ghana to influence the 2020 US elections,https://ghanafact.com/2021/06/facebook-report-details-how-a-russia-linked-troll-farm-was-set-up-in-ghana-to-influence-the-2020-us-elections/
"COVID-19 vaccines lead to changes in the menstrual cycle of recipients A news article widely circulating on WhatsApp claims COVID-19 vaccines are changing the menstrual cycle of recipients. The article shared by   and attributed to   is titled: “This dangerous problem is happening to women after getting vaccinated!” The article was however unavailable on the website of the platform that is alleged to have originally published the story following our checks. “Nearly 4,000 women in the UK have had period problems after being vaccinated. Yes, the vaccine monitoring experts themselves have made such a claim. He also informed that the problem has been more common mainly in women between the ages of 30 and 49 years after getting the vaccine,” parts of the article said. The fact-check report would seek to verify: 
   Scientists are currently gathering data to determine if there’s a plausible link between the vaccines and changes in the menstrual cycle,” the World Health Organisation – Africa Infodemic Response Alliance (AIRA) secretariat said in response to the claim when contacted by GhanaFact. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), any link between COVID-19 vaccines and changes in the menstrual cycle of recipients could be the result of an immune response to vaccination rather than a specific vaccine component. Factors like stress, illness, and lifestyle changes can also temporarily affect the menstrual cycle of women. “Any changes to your menstrual cycle after vaccination should be temporary and harmless. Vaccines are approved for use only after they have been found to be safe and effective,” the World Health Organization(WHO) stressed. A research paper by the   about a plausible link between the COVID-19 vaccine and irregular menstrual cycle identified that “more than 30,000 reports of these events had been made to MHRA’s [UK’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency] yellow card surveillance scheme for adverse drug reactions by 2 September 2021, across all COVID-19 vaccines currently offered.” The author of the article,  , a reproductive specialist at Imperial College London, further explained that most people who report a change to their period after vaccination find that it returns to normal the following cycle and, importantly, there is no evidence that COVID-19 vaccination adversely affects fertility. “If there is a connection, it is likely to be a result of the immune response to vaccination rather than a specific vaccine component,” Dr. Male stated. According to  , a co-leading global effort on equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines, the HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccine and the flu vaccine have been reported to affect menstrual cycles temporarily so it wouldn’t be surprising if COVID-19 vaccines do so briefly either. Gavi further explained three factors that could possibly lead to problems with women’s menstrual cycle after taking their COVID-19 vaccines;   Meanwhile, the   has stated that COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective.

"On November 21, 2021, Ghana confirmed two cases of the Omicron variant. According to the Director-General of the  , Dr Patrick Kuma-Aboagye the cases were detected in two passengers travelling from Nigeria and South Africa. “Through the robust testing at the Kotoka International Airport, Ghana has detected the Omicron variant already and the cases have come mainly from Nigeria and South Africa. The very first case that was detected through our sequencing was on the 21  of November,” he stated at a press conference. So far  —and at least 142 globally—have detected the Omicron variant. The Delta variant has been reported in 42 countries in Africa. In West Africa where COVID-19 cases are on the rise, the number of Omicron sequences undertaken by countries including Cabo Verde, Ghana, Nigeria and Senegal is growing. In Cabo Verde and Nigeria, Omicron is currently the dominant variant.       On November 26, 2021,  , following advice from the WHO’s Technical Advisory Group on Virus Evolution. The variant was given the name   and based on the currently available evidence, the overall risk related to Omicron remains very high. The overall threat posed by Omicron largely depends on four key questions: Omicron has a significant growth advantage over Delta, leading to rapid spread in the community with higher levels of incidence than previously seen in this pandemic. Despite a lower risk of severe disease and death following infection than previous SARS-CoV-2 variants, the very high levels of transmission nevertheless have resulted in significant increases in hospitalization, continue to pose overwhelming demands on health care systems in most countries, and may lead to significant morbidity, particularly in vulnerable populations.       © 2022 All rights reserved","February 2, 2022",False,Omicron variant: What you need to know,https://ghanafact.com/2022/02/omicron-variant-what-you-need-to-know/
"Multiple variants of the virus that causes COVID-19 have been identified in many countries around the world and this has been accompanied by a wave of misinformation being shared online. The Omicron variant, variant B.1.1.529, which is the newest variant was first reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) on 24 November 2021 and was  . The variant which was first detected in South Africa has since been found in   and in at least 142 countries around the world. The rapid spread of the Omicron variant came with high global anxiety compared to the other variants ( first detected in South Africa,  first detected in Brazil,  first detected in India) and this fueled many myths and misconceptions. Here are 9 myths found on the internet and   to burst these lingering myths:    Omicron only causes mild disease.  Omicron appears to be less severe than the Delta variant, but it should not be seen as mild. According to the World Health Organization, a number of countries have shown that infection-severity from Omicron in their populations has been lower compared to Delta. However, these Omicron impacts have been mostly observed in countries with high vaccination rates: the comparatively lower rate of hospitalizations and deaths so far is in large part thanks to vaccination, particularly of vulnerable groups. The WHO said, “without the vaccines many more people would likely be in the hospital.”   As Omicron is less severe, we will see fewer hospitalizations and our health systems will be able to cope.  Omicron still presents a high risk to our health systems. The WHO said “the overall risk related to Omicron remains very high for a number of reasons. Current data indicates that Omicron has an even higher growth advantage compared to Delta.” Even if an Omicron infection was less severe compared to Delta, the rapid increase in cases will result in an increase in hospitalizations, putting pressure on health care systems for treating patients with both COVID-19 and other types of disease.    Vaccines don’t work against Omicron.  Vaccines offer the best available protection against Omicron. “Vaccination is expected to provide important protection against severe disease and death caused by Omicron, as it does with the other variants still in circulation,” the WHO emphasized. Vaccination prompts the body’s immune response to the virus, which not only protects us from the variants currently in circulation – including Omicron – but is also likely to give protection from severe disease due to future mutations of COVID-19. Unvaccinated people will not become severely ill from Omicron Unvaccinated people are at most risk from Omicron. The sheer volume of new COVID-19 infections is already leading to more hospitalizations in countries where Omicron has become the dominant variant, with most of those who require hospital treatment being unvaccinated people.    Omicron is just like a common cold.  Omicron is much more dangerous than a common cold; Omicron is not like a common cold because it is more likely than a cold to land you in hospital. “We have seen that people infected with the Omicron variant are being hospitalized and some people have already died as a result of it. It is also expected that people who have been infected from Omicron and recover are also at risk of developing so-called Long COVID conditions,” the WHO cautioned.   Previous infection provides immunity from Omicron Omicron can reinfect people that have previously had COVID-19; If you have had COVID-19 previously, you should still get vaccinated, as reinfection from Omicron is still possible, with the risk that you could become seriously ill, pass on the virus to others or develop Long COVID. Getting fully vaccinated, whether you have had COVID-19 or not, is the best way to protect yourself and others from severe disease, being hospitalized and potentially dying from the virus.    Boosters are ineffective against severe disease from Omicron.  Booster jabs are effective at increasing protection against severe disease from Omicron and all other COVID-19 variants; This will literally boost your protection against severe disease from Omicron and other variants of COVID-19. The effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, as with many other vaccines, such as the one for flu, wanes over time, so if you are offered a booster jab, take it. The WHO advised that;      Face masks are useless against Omicron as the gaps in them are larger than the virus.  Wearing masks is an effective protective measure to help reduce the infection and spread of Omicron. “Based on the evidence that we have so far, all preventive measures that work against the Delta variant continue to be effective against Omicron – and this includes mask-wearing,” the WHO has said. Omicron is moving so quickly that, in addition to vaccination, all other preventive measures – wearing a mask; cleaning hands; physical distancing; avoiding closed, confined or crowded spaces; coughing or sneezing into a bent elbow or tissue; and ensuring good ventilation – are needed to stem the wave of infection and protect health workers and systems.   With Omicron being less severe, we are nearing the end of the pandemic.  It is important to recognize that we still have some way to go to ending the pandemic. The WHO said: “Although we are currently reporting fewer hospitalizations and deaths across the Region as a whole, we are, however, dealing with a huge surge in COVID-19 cases.” In those countries where Omicron is becoming or has become the dominant variant, COVID-19 cases are doubling every 1.5 to 3 days – with hospitalizations rapidly rising as a result.     © 2022 All rights reserved","February 10, 2022",False,COVID-19: WHO debunks 9 myths about Omicron variant,https://ghanafact.com/2022/02/4021/

" Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin can be used in treating COVID-19  Stella Emmanuel Yet another video of Dr Stella Immanuel, a medical practitioner in Houston in the USA, recommending unproven drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 has surfaced on WhatsApp platforms in Ghana. In July 2020, Dr Immanuel was at the centre of controversy after she falsely claimed that hydroxychloroquine was the cure for COVID-19. A claim subsequently reinforced by former US President, Donald Trump. In a new 8 minutes and 36 seconds long video, Stella Immanuel claimed that she was using hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin to effectively treat  COVID-19 patients. “I have been using Ivermectin to take care of patients. Usually, I put patients on Hydro chloroquine and Ivermectin. I have been doing that since April. Nobody has ever said anything about it. I have treated a lot of patients with ivermectin, I have given hydroxychloroquine, for patients who couldn’t tolerate hydroxy, I gave them Ivermectin and for patients that were sicker, I gave them both Ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine… I told you people from day one that this thing is diabolic.

This group is an independent, international panel of experts, which includes clinical care experts in multiple specialities and also include an ethicist and patient-partners. They determined that the evidence on whether ivermectin reduces mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, need for hospital admission and time to clinical improvement in COVID-19 patients is of “very low certainty,” due to the small sizes and methodological limitations of available trial data, including a small number of events.

The video has been shared on Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp, published by blogging websites[ ]  and also been mainstreamed by traditional media [   ] reinforcing the misleading characterization.   ” I just saw it on different platforms after I first saw it in one of the groups [on WhatsApp] I belong to and they cited a place between Bolga and Bawku as where the thing took place,” Managing Editor of A1 Radio in the Upper East region said in an interview with GhanaFact.     Days of torrential rains in Ghana’s Upper East and North East regions and the subsequent spillage of excess water from the Bagre Dam in Burkina Faso have caused flooding across large swaths of areas in that part of the country, destroying homes, farms and displacing residents. The regional coordinator of the National Disaster Management Organization (NADMO) in the Upper East region, Jerry Asamani has confirmed that four persons have so far died due to the torrential rains.   The viral video that shows the hapless cattle being washed away by the floodwaters did not happen in any part of the Upper East region of Ghana, but rather happened in Mexico after the country was hit by tropical storm Hanna on July 26, 2020.

" COVID-19 vaccine recipients can not donate blood or plasma  Online platforms   A News article with the headline – “Red Cross is warning all Americans that Covid-vaccinated humans are ineligible for donating plasma” – is circulating on WhatsApp in Ghana. According to the article published by a  , the warning is an admission from American Red Cross that “the COVID-19 vaccines wipe out any natural antibodies that any person’s body has created to fight Covid-19 or its variants, so those people cannot help others fighting and/or dying from the China flu.”   The article further claimed that COVID-19 vaccines render the plasma useless after wiping out the antibodies of the vaccinated persons. “So, if America were to reach the 100 per cent vaccinated goal that the tyrannical government wants to reach so badly, then there would be nobody left who could donate plasma, blood or organs to anyone ever again, including their own offspring or family members with the same blood type,” it also said. But how factual is this article? This fact-check report will seek to verify the claim. GhanaFact found that blogging website   sourced the article from   – a platform that regularly publishes conspiracy theories, misinformation and disinformation about the COVID-19 vaccines. Meanwhile, the  has debunked the claim that COVID-19 vaccine recipients cannot donate blood or plasma. “There are claims circulating that incorrectly state that the Red Cross will not accept convalescent plasma donations from those who have received the COVID-19 vaccine because the vaccine wipes out those antibodies making the convalescent plasma ineffective in treating other COVID-19 patients,” the humanitarian organisation said on its website. Here are further clarifications to some lingering questions provided by the American Red Cross.   “Yes, you can donate blood after getting a COVID-19 vaccine, as long as you are symptom-free and feeling well at the time of the donation,” Red Cross has said. However, “please come prepared to share the manufacturer name of the vaccine you received. If you do not know the name of the vaccine manufacturer, we request you wait two weeks to donate after vaccination, out of precaution,” the association indicated.   ? The   allows people who have received a COVID-19 vaccine to donate dedicated COVID-19 convalescent plasma within six months of their infection of the virus, based on data that antibodies from natural infection can decline after six months, however, the Red Cross has discontinued our convalescent plasma collection program. Explaining this, the association said, “throughout the pandemic, the Red Cross has adapted its collection of lifesaving products to meet the needs of all patients including COVID-19 patients. Due to the decline in hospital demand and because the Red Cross and our industry partners have been able to build a sufficient supply of convalescent plasma to meet the foreseeable needs of COVID-19 patients the Red Cross stopped collecting convalescent plasma completely on June 14.”   Donating blood after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine does not reduce a donor’s protection from the virus. Similar to other vaccines such as measles, mumps or influenza, the COVID-19 vaccine is designed to generate an immune response to help protect an individual from illness. A donor’s immune response is not impacted by giving blood. Plasma donation and COVID-19 convalescent plasma donation are different.

Joe Timm who introduces himself as a Respiratory Therapist claimed that taking the vaccine could compromise the immune system of recipients, cause blood clots and subsequently weaken their hearts. In the 2 minutes and 50 seconds long video, the speaker in the video said he is struggling with these side effects after receiving the Pfizer vaccines. This fact-check  report will seek to verify the following:   “Hi everyone, I want to give you a little information about the COVID vaccination and I hope you watch the whole thing because there must be a twist in the hidden aspect. I am a Respiratory Therapist. I have been on the frontline of the COVID-19 battle since day one up until now. I am fully vaccinated on May 6, 2021. About two weeks after that, that’s when the trouble starts…  ” he partly said in the video.   GhanaFact checks on TikTok showed Joe Timm has published similar videos making several claims via his .

Like all vaccines,   go through a rigorous, multi-stage testing process, including large clinical trials that involve tens of thousands of people,” the   has emphasized. “COVID-19 vaccines do not compromise your immune system,” WHO Africa Infodemic Response Alliance told GhanaFact. COVID-19 vaccines provide protection against the disease by helping the body develop an   which then reduces the risk of contracting the illness and its consequences. According to the WHO, when you get a vaccine, your   responds by recognizing the invading germ, such as the virus or bacteria and then produce antibodies to fight disease. Therefore, the claim that COVID-19 compromises the immune system is FALSE.   “A very small number of myocarditis and pericarditis cases (inflammation of the heart) have been reported following the Pfizer vaccine.  In Europe, where the vaccine has been rolled out in larger numbers, a rate of less than one person in a million has been reported. Most of these cases have been mild and not required treatment or hospitalisation,” according to the Heart Foundation in New Zealand. The   is New Zealand’s heart charity, leading the fight against the country’s single biggest killer – heart disease. “There have been reports of very rare cases of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the membrane surrounding the heart) following the second dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines,” the WHO Africa Infodemic Response Alliance (WHO/AIRA) said. Myocarditis and pericarditis can be caused by many factors, including infections, viruses, medicines and environmental factors. The currently available data suggest that there is also a potential relationship between these symptoms and mRNA vaccines. Research is underway to understand more. According to the WHO, cases have been mostly reported in younger men aged 12 – 29 (40.6 cases of myocarditis per million-second doses) compared to females of the same age group (4.2 cases per million-second doses), “However, globally, mRNA vaccines such as Pfizer and Moderna have been used to protect millions of people against COVID-19. A significant amount of data is available from both clinical trials and country surveillance programmes on their efficacy and safety”, the AIRA secretariate told GhanaFact. The claim has been rated  .   According to the Heart Foundation of New Zealand, there have been overseas reports of some people experiencing blood clots after getting the Covid-19 vaccine. These reports are not linked to the Pfizer vaccine. Meanwhile, reports of blood clots have been linked to Vaxzevria (AstraZeneca) or the Janssen COVID-19 vaccines. On July 4, 2021, the   (EMA) announced a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, as a very rare side effect of Vaxzevria (formerly COVID-19 vaccine AstraZeneca). Also, the   (CDC) and the FDA recommended a pause of the Johnson and Johnson COVID-19 vaccine on April 13, 2021. At the time of the pause, about 6.8 million doses of the vaccine had been given. The purpose of this pause was to further investigate rare blood clots that had been reported after vaccination. “There have been reports of very rare but serious cases of blood clots accompanied by low platelet counts (known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS)) occurring 3 to 30 days after vaccination with COVID-19 non-replicant adenovirus vector-based vaccines (such as the AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccines),” the   has indicated.

" British doctors call for a cessation of COVID-19 vaccination and other claims about the safety of the vaccines WhatsApp video  3 FALSE, 1 MISLEADING A video produced by an American Television Network, One American News Network (OAN) claims doctors in England are calling for a complete cessation of COVID-19 vaccination after discovering they are unsafe for humans. “More and more evidence from around the world is pouring in that raises doubt about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines for the Chinese coronavirus. A new report from doctors from England calls for a complete cessation of using COVID vaccines on humans,” one of the two presenters seen in the video partly said. The fact-check report will seek to verify four claims made in the 4 minutes and 38 seconds long video.   “A new report from doctors from England calls for a complete cessation of using COVID vaccines on humans. According to the UK based evidence-based medicine consultancy group which submitted its findings to Britain’s department of health claiming there is more than enough evidence to declare the COVID-19 vaccines unsafe for use in humans. Doctors say after examining official public health records, they looked at a number of side effects of the vaccine including bleeding and clotting, unexpected immune system reactions, unusual pain reactions, neurological responses, loss of sight, hearing, speech or smells,” one of the presenters partly said in the video. “The ‘urgent British report’ is not official. It’s a whitepaper written by a physicist who supports ineffective and unproven pharmacological treatments for covid-19. The report uses vaccine suspected adverse events data from MHRA Yellow Card as evidence that covid vaccines are unsafe, but these data alone cannot be interpreted to reach conclusions about the existence of problems associated with vaccines,” the Chief Executive of the British Medical Regulatory Agency (MHRA), Dr June Reine told  Meanwhile, the   (AIRA) when contacted by GhanaFact said all COVID-19 vaccines went through rigorous clinical testing to ensure that they are safe and effective. “There are strict protections in place to help ensure the safety of all COVID-19 vaccines. Before receiving validation from WHO and national regulatory agencies, COVID-19 vaccines must undergo rigorous testing in clinical trials to prove that they meet internationally agreed benchmarks for safety and efficacy,” the AIRA Secretariat said. The WHO further emphasized that “unprecedented scientific collaborations have allowed COVID-19 vaccine research, development, and authorizations to be completed in record time – to meet the urgent need for these vaccines while maintaining high safety standards.” As with all vaccines, WHO and regulatory authorities will continuously monitor the use of COVID-19 vaccines to identify and respond to any safety issues that might arise, and through that process to assure they remain safe for use around the world. The claim is rated FALSE. “Adverse reaction affecting pregnancy including miscarriage,” a presenter said in the video. “Pregnant women should get vaccinated when the benefits outweigh the risks. We do not have enough data on the safety of vaccines for pregnant women. However, data from the United States, where around 90,000 pregnant women have been vaccinated with messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines like the Pfizer-BioNTech and Modena vaccines have not raised any safety concerns,” the World Health Organization told GhanaFact when alerted to the claim. According to the WHO, countries have different guidelines based on their own situations. In countries where pregnant women can choose to get the vaccine, health workers would have to help them to understand the risks and benefits so they can make an informed decision. “If you are unsure, please ask your doctor,” the WHO/AIRA said. The claim is MISLEADING.   “Researchers explained that the products in the vaccine are toxic to humans called for an immediate halt to the vaccination programme to conduct a full investigation into these harmful effects.” “There is absolutely no poison in COVID-19 vaccines and over 5 billion doses have been given all around the world so far,” the   secretariat said in response to the claim. COVID-19 vaccines substantially reduce the risk of people getting sick and dying of the virus. They are a   in ending the pandemic. The claim that products in the vaccines are toxic is FALSE. “To be clear, this is an experimental drug. And it is now being administered without proper testing or safety protocols. Something that is never being done before for any other disease and we are witnessing the consequences of that first hand,” one presenter said. “In the past, vaccines have been developed through a series of consecutive steps that can take many years. Now, given the urgent need for COVID-19 vaccines, unprecedented financial investments and scientific collaborations are changing how vaccines are developed,” according to the  . Before receiving validation from WHO and national regulatory agencies, COVID-19 vaccines went through rigorous testing in clinical trials to prove that they meet internationally agreed benchmarks for safety and efficacy.

"A collaborative research paper on Ghana’s work in health communication about the COVID‐19 pandemic has found disparities in health information access across Ghana, especially in rural communities. Like many countries around the world, the COVID‐19 pandemic has had devastating economic and humanitarian effects on Ghana. “Health information access disparities, particularly in rural areas of Ghana worsened the impact of COVID‐19,” the study by an assistant professor of global media in the College of Journalism and Mass Communication at the University of Georgia,   and a doctoral candidate at the Brian Lamb School of Communication at Purdue University,   highlighted. Ghana has recorded more than 160,000 coronavirus cases in the last two years, with 1,445 deaths also recorded – the   has stated. According to the paper –   – despite impressive strides toward proper health education about the pandemic, in resource‐limited contexts, health information dissemination occurs within a structural context that restricts the enactment of agency and further marginalizes the most vulnerable. Assessing health information dissemination in Ghana, the research underscored that health education campaigns have drastically reduced in the country due to a lack of government commitment to providing funding for health education programs. “The  , which is mandated to carry out such campaigns, was only provided with GHS 100 (the equivalent of $20 at the time) to develop and launch health education campaigns in each district office across the country,” the study stated. Historically, Ghana has employed various avenues to facilitate information dissemination on various health issues such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, cholera, and guinea worm. This medium of communication was culturally suited to the local context, and studies have provided evidence of the effectiveness of “edutainment” programs. The paper also said communication about health information has grown complicated as the public health education sector is burdened with not only providing education but fighting misinformation and disinformation propelled by access to platforms such as WhatsApp and Facebook. Although digital media access continues to rise around the world, the digital divide continues to undermine access for people in rural communities and worse, the gap in literacy skills creates “information deserts in an increasingly digitized world,” the researchers stated. The prevalence of fake news, lack of access to credible media platforms, limited digital media accessibility and media literacy also have exacerbated information deserts that predate COVID‐19.

Conventional cooking (temperatures at or above 70°C in all parts of a food item) will inactivate the H5N1 virus, so properly cooked poultry meat is therefore safe to consume. “It’s still safe to continue to eat our eggs and chicken. Let’s cook them well and don’t eat already dead birds. They are unwholesome even during times with no bird flu outbreak,” Dr Benjamin Sasu said. The primary risk factor for human infection appears to be direct or indirect exposure to infected live or dead poultry or contaminated environments, such as live bird markets. “Slaughtering, defeathering, handling carcasses of infected poultry, and preparing poultry for consumption, especially in household settings, are also likely to be risk factors.” the WHO further stated. The H5N1 virus, if present in poultry meat, is not killed by refrigeration or freezing.   Meanwhile, the Veterinary Services Directorate has confirmed that all samples taken from people directly working with the affected birds in Ghana didn’t yield a positive result for the virus.

" Government has received $1.4 billion from oil production  Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa The Member of Parliament for North Tongu, Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa has claimed that the current government has received $1.4 billion from the commercial production and export of oil. “I was reading the Public Interest and Accountability Committee (PIAC) report a few days ago submitted to Parliament. This government is the most blessed in history. According to PIAC, they receive $1.4 billion as per our oil receipts,” he said on   on July 10, 2023.

So far, the committee has published eighteen (18) reports (Nine Annual and Nine Semi-annual Reports). 
 In fact-checking the claim, GhanaFact will reference the Public Interest and Accountability Committee (PIAC) report published in the first quarter of 2023. The 2023  , “Annual Report on the Management and Use of Petroleum Revenues,” featured the revenue generated from January to December 2022 from oil production. The that “total petroleum revenue in 2022 is the highest for a single year since the inception of petroleum production in Ghana with a figure of US$1.43 billion.” “At the close of the year 2021, there was undistributed petroleum receipts of US$15,113,467.000 brought forward to 2022, thereby bringing the total amount available for distribution from the PHF to US$1,443,709,456.24,” the PIAC   explained.

"A decision by the Ghanaian government to slap 17 pesewas on fuel prices as COVID-19 levy has generated outrage among petroleum consumers on social media. This evolved into a social media campaign under #FixTheCountryNow, with many citizens venting their frustrations with the rising cost of living, the country’s high debt levels and the crippling economic fortunes of Ghana. The online pressure soon morphed into a full-blown planned demonstration. This forced government to   the levy to 9 pesewas, while the Ghana Police Service has also secured a court order to halt the intended protest.   Vice President Dr Mahamudu Bawumia in response to the exasperation being shown by the public has defended the government’s track record in “fixing problems” and in a   on May 6, has provided a list of 70 problems he claims the government inherited and what has been done so far. We are four months into our four-year mandate. The job of government is to fix problems. This is what we have been doing since 2017.” He partly said in the post. This fact-check report will assess the accuracy of 5 verifiable claims with publicly available data. The timelines to be considered in verifying the claims would be December 2016(Problem inherited) and December 2020 (What we have done so far). Meanwhile, the problem inherited and what we have done so far would be considered as one claim.   GhanaFact verified this by comparing the year-on-year inflation rate for 2016 to the rate for 2020, which represent when the former administration handed over power and when the four-year tenure of the current government also ended. According to data from the Ghana Statistical Service(GSS) inflation rate for   was 15.4%, while that for   was 10.4%. Meanwhile the inflation rates for   and   stand at 10.3% and 8.5% respectively. So, the claim will be rated   because the 2016 rate was accurately captured in the claim, while 10.4% inflation rate for December 2020 was understated as 10.3%.       According to available data from the Bank of Ghana (BOG), Average Commercial Banks Lending Rate as at   was 28.09% contrary to the 32% suggested in the claim. Meanwhile the   as of December 2020 was 21.10%. Meanwhile, the Finance Minister Ken Ofori-Atta through government’s   and   Budget Statements and Economic Policies stated that the average lending rate as of December 2016 was 31.2% and 31.68% respectively. The claim is rated  .     The claim that   secured the 58  position in the 2020 Global Food Security Index report is inaccurate. According to the report, Algeria not Ghana secured the 58  position with an overall score point of 61.8 while Ghana holds the 77  position with an overall score of 53.0 just as Nepal. Meanwhile, in  , Ghana ranked 78  on Global Food Security Index. Claim 3 will therefore be rated as  . A sovereign credit rating is an independent assessment of the creditworthiness of a country. There are four international credit rating agencies, and they include: Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s, Fitch and Scope Ratings.     Moody’s assigns its  for “obligations considered speculative and subject to high credit risk.” Entities that receive this rating may be experiencing financial instability or hold inadequate cash reserves relative to their business needs, debt, or other financial obligations.  indicate that material default risk is present, but a limited margin of safety remains.

"Claims about Ghana’s economic rebound and public debt President Nana Akufo-Addo  has stressed the deep structural fragilities in Africa exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic while delivering some remarks at the G20 Compact with Africa Summit in Berlin, Germany. Launched under   in 2017, the Compact aims to promote private investment in Africa. With other African Heads of State present, the Ghanaian leader highlighted his country’s economic recovery “as one of the few economies to have recorded positive growth in 2020” and that Ghana has had a “strong start to 2021.” According to President Nana Akufo-Addo, Ghana’s economy has recorded “a growth rate of 3.1% and 8.9% in the first and second quarters of this year, respectively.” He also added that public debt levels in Ghana currently was “77.1% of GDP.” So, we sought to verify these claims:   The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is Ghana’s official measure of economic growth. There are three different approaches for calculating GDP. These are the production approach, the expenditure approach and the income approach. The National Statistical Office, Ghana Statistical Service (GSS) uses the production approach to calculate Ghana’s GDP on a quarterly basis.

Therefore, the claim that Ghana recorded a growth rate of 3.1% in the first quarter of 2021 is rated    The Ghana Statistical Service (GSS) is yet to release a provisional GDP growth rate for the second quarter of 2021. According to a GSS schedule for releasing the GDP quarterly bulletin, the expected date of publication of provisional GDP estimates for the second quarter of 2021 is September 15. It is therefore unclear where the President on Friday, 27th August 2021 sourced the provisional growth rate of 8.9% which he suggested was for the second quarter of 2021. So far this year, the GSS has followed its schedule for publishing provisional GDP estimates as evidenced by the release of the   on June 16. Therefore, the claim is rated   since evidence publicly available at the time of publishing this report neither proves nor disproves the statement.   “The provisional nominal debt stock as at end-June 2021 stood at GHȼ334.56 billion (US$58.04 billion), representing 77.1 percent of GDP,” Minister of Finance, Ken Ofori-Atta stated when presenting a   to Parliament on July 29.

" Ghana Card duly recognized globally as a valid e-passport  Mahamudu Bawumia “Ghana Card is now an e-passport,” has been dominating the news cycle over the last 48 hours in Ghana after the country’s Vice President Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia announced it to the public across popular social media platforms,   and  . The second gentleman in November 2021 during a lecture ( ) at Ashesi University had hinted of efforts by the government to get the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to recognise the Ghana Card as an e-passport by the first quarter of 2022.

A number of credible online news platforms in Ghana ( ,  ,  ,  ,   and  ) have published stories reinforcing the claims that have been made by the top Ghanaian state officials.   GhanaFact as part of our verification of the claims made by the Vice President, Ghana’s High Commissioner to Canada- Ransford Sowah and the National Identification Authority (NIA) sent an email to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to clarify:         “Ghana is a participant in the   ,” a Communications Officer at the Office of the Secretary-General International Civil Aviation Organization, William Raillant-Clark confirmed in an email response to GhanaFact on February 10.

However, “the establishment of international travel requirements, and immigration policy generally, including what (if any) documentation must be provided by the traveller, is wholly and exclusively a sovereign state responsibility,” the ICAO clarified. A subsequent tweet by the   said the reports that it had agreed that the Ghanaian ID card is equivalent to an ePassport were “incorrect.” ICAO is aware of recent and incorrect media reports claiming that ICAO has agreed that the Ghanaian ID card is equivalent to an ePassport. However, it is not ICAO’s role to certify the use of a State’s Identity Card for international travel in place of a passport. — ICAO (@icao)  It also remains unclear what informed the claim by Ghanaian authorities that the Ghana card can now be used to travel across 197 borders and 44,000 airports in the world because the “ICAO only has 193 member States, and of these 79 participate in the PKD (including Ghana),” William Raillant-Clark said. Since 2011, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has been operating a database for which each authorized state provides a cryptographic key: the ICAO Public Key Directory (PKD). However, inclusion in the ICAO PKD is subject to strict conditions and in particular, the production and issuance of passports in the country concerned must meet high-security requirements. Cryptovision, a Gelsenkirchen-based company that provided Ghana with both software and consulting services ahead of the country being accepted into the ICAO Public Key Directory referenced the Ghanaian passport and not the Ghana Card in meeting the requirements that got the ICAO to include the country’s key in their PKD. “Cryptovision is especially proud of this, as the Gelsenkirchen-based company has built the cryptographic infrastructure for the Ghanaian passport.

That is the claim being made by the majority leader in parliament Osei Kyei Mensah Bonsu during a radio interview on Hello FM as the debate on the government’s attempt to introduce an electronic transaction levy intensifies. “  when they come to power. And so, if that same person comes to tell you that what you are doing will bring hardship but, they said it will generate revenue for the country, then why did they put it in their manifesto?” the   said.

In JM, the NPP government has the perfect PRO for all efforts towards revenue mobilisation, including e-levy (See P.99 of his NDC manifesto 2020 on a promise to impose uniform fees on all e-transactions). NPP should just be modest enough to use NDC’s JM more. My humble advice.  — Gabby Otchere-Darko (@GabbyDarko)  This fact-check report will seek to verify;   Government in the   said it had decided to place a levy on all electronic transactions to widen the tax net and rope in the informal sector. The “Electronic Transaction Levy” or “E-Levy” has since divided opinion among Ghanaians and faced stiff opposition among minority Members of Parliament. Meanwhile, a bill that is supposed to be passed by parliament before the implementation of the E-Levy has stalled due to the minority in parliament’s opposition to the tax and the government’s efforts to pursue broader engagement with citizens. According to the government, the 1.5% e-levy will be charged on the value of digital transactions and only exempt daily transactions of a cumulative value of Gh¢100.00 or less, per person. This comes after the Deputy Majority leader, Alexander Afenyo Markins announced the government’s decision to reduce the e-levy from 1.75% to 1.5%. “Government has shifted from 1.75% to 1.5%,” the Deputy Majority leader and Member of Parliament for the Effutu Constituency,   said.   No part of the 2020   states any plan by the opposition party to tax electronic transactions, GhanaFact checks have shown.

Telecom company, MTN used to charge a transaction fee of 1% but have since reduced it to 0.75% on its mobile money(momo) service, while Vodafone has a 0%  charge for its electronic payment service (vodacash). “By a uniform transaction fee,[it] is meant ensuring all Telcos charge the same fee to be agreed…The electronic levy(e-levy) on the other hand is a tax imposed on the value of the transaction (amount transferred).

GhanaFact also contacted a senior communications, public policy and research executive and former head of corporate communication at the Ghana Chamber of Telecommunications, Barnabas Nii Laryea and he said “fee Policy is to guide industry. Tax Policy to collect revenue,” in response to the difference between the e-levy and the uniform transaction fee policy. According to him, a fee policy is to harmonize fees on transactions across platforms to bring a sense of homogeneity in the industry. “A fee policy is not about collecting tax revenue for the government but, the electronic transaction levy is tax revenue for the government,” he reiterated.   The 2020   proposed the introduction of a uniform transaction fee policy to guide the electronic payments industry But it is  to claim the manifesto proposed taxing electronic transactions © 2022 All rights reserved","February 23, 2022",False,FACT-CHECK: 2020 NDC manifesto did NOT propose taxing electronic transactions,https://ghanafact.com/2022/02/4065/
" 3 claims about Ghana’s CPI score and funding of OSP to fight corruption  Prof. Enoch Opoku Antwi/ TV3 A governance and leadership expert, Prof. Enoch Opoku Antwi, speaking on  , a weekend political talk show, on July 8, 2023, has made some claims about Ghana’s effort to fight corruption over the last few years. Prof. Antwi said the prevalence of corruption in Ghana has continued to impact our Corruption Perception Index score over the years while highlighting how much the country spends on resourcing the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP) to fight the menace. “The Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP) had 150 cases in front of him, and we’ve spent almost GH¢500 million on the OSP office,” he said ( ). “…According to Transparency International, if you hit 50 and above, you are not corrupt. Mahama was able to get to 49 (Member of Parliament for Tamale Central, Murtala Mohammed, interjected that it was 47), and he ended at 43. But has been 43 from New Patriotic Party (NPP) time till now,” he added ( ). This fact-check report will seek to verify the accuracy of three claims: The government has spent GH¢500 million on the OSP To fact-check this claim, GhanaFact will rely on financial reports from the Ministry of Finance focusing on the Office of the Special Prosecutor. GhanaFact will be referencing the “ .” On pages 7 and 8 of the report, under the sub-heading “Expenditure Trends for the Medium-Term,” lies the amount allocated and approve for the operational activities of the OSP. “To enable the Office of the Special Prosecutor to carry out its planned activities over the medium-term, total amounts of GH¢3,791,214.00, GH¢180,160,225.00 and GH¢138,146,482.00 were appropriated under the various Economic Classification for 2018, 2019 and 2020 financial years respectively with funding sources being GOG [Government of Ghana].” Also, the report highlighted that in 2021, “the Office has been allocated a total budget of GH¢124,103,085 out of which GH¢43,473,043, GH¢50,630,042 and GH¢30,000,000 are for compensation of employees, Good and Services and Capital Expenditure respectively.” Under the expenditure trends for the medium-term in the   the Office of the Special Prosecutor was initially allocated GH¢ 170,504,000.00 in 2022 but was later reviewed to a total budget of GH¢138,852,800.00. Meanwhile, the Finance Ministry budgeted GH¢129,549,380.00 for the 2023 financial operations for the Office of the Special Prosecutors. The table below shows the amounts allocated to the office of the Special Prosecutor from 2018 to 2023, according to reports by the Ministry of Finance. However, from available public records –   the Office of the Special Prosecutor does not sometimes receive budgeted/ allocated funds. As of November 2021, the Office of the Special Prosecutor’s actual expenditure stood at GH¢ 58,461,165.53 despite the total allocation for the year being GH¢ 124,103,085.00 ( ). In 2022  the   while 625,417.41 was paid in 2020 ( ). The claim is  per available public records. If you hit 50 and above on the CPI, you are not corrupt The Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) is the most widely used global corruption ranking in the world. It measures how corrupt each country’s public sector is perceived to be, according to experts and businesspeople. A country’s score is the perceived level of public sector corruption on a scale of 0-100, where 0 means highly corrupt and 100 means very clean. “If you score 50 it means you have been able to score half of the total mark. But generally, the higher you score the better you are as a country relative to corruption,” a former Executive Director of Ghana Integrity Initiative (GII), a local chapter of Transparency International, Vitus Azeem explained when contacted by GhanaFact. “Small fluctuations or changes in a country’s CPI score are not usually significant, which is why every year in the  we mark all those countries that have undergone a “statistically significant” change,” Transparency International has stated on its website. The claim is  The former government recorded a CPI score of 49 and 43 within 4 years GhanaFact will use the Corruption Perception Index report published by Transparency International from   to verify the claim. The CPI   of at least 3 data sources drawn from 13 different corruption surveys and assessments. These data sources are collected by a variety of reputable institutions, including the World Bank and the World Economic Forum. Analysing the report from Transparency International, it is inaccurate to suggest that former President John Dramani Mahama’s highest score in the Corruption Perception Index is 49, and it will be an understatement to say it was 47 as indicated by the MP for Tamale Central. Also, it is inaccurate to suggest the governing Party (NPP) led by President Akufo Addo has maintained the 43 scores since it came into power.

Fuel prices in the West African nation have shot up together with commodity price increases – while the local currency, Ghana Cedi has come under enormous pressure from the dollar and other foreign currencies – depreciating in value considerably in the last couple of months. The one-on-one BBC interview has since generated heated online debate with some social media users questioning the accuracy of some of the claims made by the President. It’s very disingenuous to say the e-levy is taxing “an industry” and not people. Very.  — Audrey (@audreyveronne)  This fact-check report seeks to verify:   “Britain which is suffering the worst standard of living statistics for over 30 years,” President Nana Akufo-Addo partly said in the interview. The United Kingdom (UK) is facing its biggest drop in living standards in any single financial year since 1956, according to the  . The rise in inflation to a 40-year high in Britain this year is expected to reduce real household disposable incomes on a per-person basis by 2.2 per cent. The UK government forecaster in its   said the underlying reason for the reduction in disposable incomes comes from several sources including the fact that wages have failed to keep pace with rising prices.

The “Electronic Transaction Levy” or “E-Levy” bill has since been passed by a   and subsequently received   – despite   challenging the legality and constitutionality of the passage of the bill in parliament. According to the government, the 1.5% “E-Levy” will be charged on the value of digital transactions and only exempt daily transactions of a cumulative value of Gh¢100.00 or less, per person. “E-Levy was not designed to be absorbed or paid for by mobile money operators. The industry pays capital gains tax, corporation taxes,  import levies, PAYE, WHT [Withholding tax] on commissions earned by agents, vendors etc. Eg. In 2020 the industry paid about 220m cedis taxes from the mobile money sector only,” a senior communication, public policy and research executive and former head of corporate communication at the Ghana Chamber of Telecommunications, Barnabas Nii Laryea told GhanaFact. He emphasized that all the taxes cited are different from the new E-Levy, which is a consumption tax paid for directly by customers using mobile money and other electronic channels and “is not incident on an industry but its users.” Before the introduction of the E-Levy, Telecom companies / Mobile Money Operators charged a transaction fee/charge for their services – effecting the transfer of money for subscribers/consumers. Telecom company, MTN used to charge a transaction fee of 1% but has since reduced it to 0.75% on its mobile money(momo) service, while Vodafone has a 0%  charge for its electronic payment service (vodacash). Before the review in transaction fees, the Ghana Chamber of Telecommunications in a December 15, 2021, statement said: “MTN and AirtelTigo have agreed to a downward revision of their P2P (person to person transfer) fees by up to 25% depending on respective operator.” “I don’t think it is up for debate. It is on the individual and not on the industry. This is a matter of tax incidence and impact analysis. The incidence is clear, it will hit individual users. If it was put on the Telcos the impact will be on them. But the incidence they could have passed onto individuals, hence the same outcome,” a tax expert with over twenty-eight (28) years experience – Dr. Abdallah Ali-Nakyea stated when we contacted him for further clarification on the claim.

A 43 seconds long video showing the former President accompanied by a group of people and interacting with a wounded man is being portrayed as a visit by the leading member of the opposition NDC to victims of the military shooting incident in Ejura that has led to the death of 2 protestors. However, available evidence shows the video is being mischaracterized and is not related to recent happenings in Ejura as claimed.

" Africa produces about 12 million graduates annually and creates 6 to 7 million jobs  Former President John Dramani Mahama As part of a   to show appreciation to Ghanaians who voted for the National Democratic Congress (NDC) in the 2020 general elections, Former President John Mahama is highlighting major developmental challenges that need immediate government attention during his visits around the country. In the Upper East Region, the 2020 presidential candidate of the NDC, engaged with the   on August 17 and was particularly worried about high youth unemployment rate. According to the former Ghanaian leader, the youth are getting disappointed in “our democratic governance and don’t see any future for themselves.” “Youth unemployment has been a problem for government’s all over the world but it is particularly a problem for governments in Africa,” he lamented. He further stated that: “About 12 million graduates coming out of universities and tertiaries all across the Africa continent and yet we are producing 6 to 7 million jobs a year and so what happens to the other 5 million graduates who cannot find employment.” This fact-check will seek to verify:   According to the  , between 10 to 12 million youth enter the workforce each year. This has been highlighted in the AfDB’s Jobs for Youth in Africa report- Strategy for Creating 25 million Jobs and Equipping 50 million Youth 2016-2025. “Africa must industrialize to end poverty and to generate employment for the 12 million young people who join its labour force every year,” the AfDB stressed in the 2018  . However, only 3 million formal jobs in both the public and private sectors are created annually across the continent, according to the   and other multilateral development finance institutions. The referenced 3 million jobs projected per year is based on data for Sub-Saharan Africa from International Monetary Fund – 2013 Working Paper on Africa’s Employment Prospects. The young people in Africa are confronted with multiple challenges ranging from economies that grew but could not create sufficient jobs prior to the global financial and economic crisis to sluggish growth post the crisis in part arising from adverse weather conditions and poor commodity prices. According to the  , Africa is the only region where the youth bulge will continue to grow in the foreseeable future. This presents both an opportunity to reap the demographic dividend and an imminent time bomb and threat to social cohesion as well as massive migration in search of opportunities if appropriate policies are not implemented to harness the dividend. Several attempts to reach the spokesperson of the Former President Joyce Bawa Mogtari to respond to our findings proved futile. We would update this report when we get a response.   So, the claim that about 12 million Africans are joining the workforce annually is accurate.

An unemployed person is defined by the GSS to refer to a person 15 years or older who, in the seven days prior to the Census Night: Did not work or did not have work to go to; and was available to work. According to  , more than 1.55 million people or 13.4% of the country’s economically active population, are out of work – so it is inaccurate to suggest the unemployment rate is estimated at 14%. The unemployment rate is the number of unemployed persons divided by the labour force which is different from the proportion of the population unemployed which is computed using the entire population 15 years and older (within and outside the labour force). In computing the unemployment rate, the 2021 PHC report used the relaxed unemployment definition which does not require that the person must be actively seeking work. The two previous censuses (2010 and 2000) used the strict definition of unemployment which required that the individual must be seeking and available for employment.

"3 claims about rising poverty levels and the destruction of Ghana’s forest reserves Kwabena Agyei Agyepong A New Patriotic Party (NPP) flagbearer aspirant,  , at the launch of his campaign to lead the party on July 11, 2023, has lamented the increasing rate of poverty in Ghana and the destruction of our natural environment. According to him,   of households live in ramshackle structures and   of Ghanaians live in poverty. This Fact-check report seeks to verify the accuracy of 3 claims made during the campaign launch.   “According to the recent housing census, 25% of households live in temporary ramshackle structures.” ( ) GhanaFact will reference   of the   report by the Ghana Statistical Service (GSS) to verify this claim. According to the census report ( , there are 20.7% non-conventional structures in Ghana. These structures include metal containers, wooden structures, or kiosks. The report explained that 27.5% of these structures could be found in urban areas and 13.1% in rural areas. Nowhere in Ghana’s first fully digital census does it state that: “25% of households live in temporary ramshackle structures.” “Proportion of non-conventional structures (metal containers, wooden structures, and kiosks) is 20 per cent or higher in five regions and less than 10 per cent in four,” the report highlighted. The Director of Communication and Dissemination at the GSS, Dr Owusu Kwagya in an interview with GhanaFact said: “the word ramshackle structure will be difficult to measure using the census standard because my understanding is that this is a kind of structure that is in disrepair, in a very bad state.” “We cannot equate the usage of the word ramshackle structure to mean uncoventional structures because the structure could be conventional or non-coventional and still be in the ramshackle state.” Therefore, the claim is rated    “60% of us (Ghanaians) are in abject poverty.”( ) To fact-check this claim GhanaFact will use the Poverty Trends in Ghana report -“ ” – by the Ghana Statistical Service, the most current available document assessing the poverty levels in Ghana. In Ghana, the practice is to develop two poverty lines: the upper poverty line (which is referred to as the poverty line) and the lower poverty line (which is referred to the extreme poverty line). The GSS report published in August 2018, explains that extreme poverty incidence is defined as the state where the standard of living is insufficient to meet the basic nutritional requirements of the household even if they devote their entire consumption budget to food. “The households whose real welfare falls below the extreme poverty line of GH¢792.2 (in 2012/13 prices) per adult equivalent per year are considered extreme poor,” the report stated. According to the  , “an estimated 8.2 percent of Ghana’s population is living in extreme poverty.” The incidence of extreme poverty has declined since 2005/06. It was 16.5 percent in that year, declining to 8.4 percent in 2012/13 and 8.2 percent in 2016/17. Meanwhile using the upper poverty line, the proportion of the population defined as poor is 23.4 percent in 2016/17. An upper poverty line of GH¢1,314 per adult equivalent per year: this incorporates both essential food and non-food consumption. Based on the 2010 Population and Housing Census (PHC) projections for 2017, about 6.8 million people in Ghana are poor. In 2020,   stated that around 24.2% of Ghana’s population live below the poverty line. Therefore, it is inaccurate to claim that 60% of Ghanaians live in abject poverty. The claim is rated  .   “We’ve lost about 60% of our green cover .”( ) In reports published by   and    on April 25, 2019, Ghana lost 60% of its forest cover in 2017. “Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire experienced the highest percent rise in primary forest loss between 2017 and 2018 of any tropical country (60 percent and 26 percent, respectively).” According to the reports, Ghana was among the top 10 countries losing the most tropical primary rainforests in 2018. The Minister of Finance, Ken Ofori Atta, further highlighted the concern during the 3rd   in  June 2023 while referencing  “According to  , in 2020, Ghana’s forest cover was close to 7.99 million hectares, accounting for 35.10% of Ghana’s total land area. Based on ‘an’ analysis of data from 2001-2015, Ghana’s annual deforestation rate was approximately 3.51%, equivalent to yearly losses of greater than 315,000 hectares. Total deforestation during this time period surpassed 4.7 million ha. Unfortunately, deforestation is not a new phenomenon in Ghana.

"A picture showing Ghana’s President, Nana Akufo-Addo seated by a bed in a private jet alongside Evelyn Aidoo, aka Serwaa Broni is being widely circulated on multiple social media platforms. However, the picture has been digitally altered. Recent social media outbursts by Serwaa Broni about her encounters with Nana Akufo-Addo have been fueling speculations of an alleged dalliance.     This has generated lots of social media buzz, with many users sharing different pictures of the President and Serwaa Broni – contributing to Serwaa Broni appearing in the top 5 trends in Ghana on Twitter at a point. Meanwhile, the President has also come under heavy criticism from the Member of Parliament for North Tongu, Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa and some section of the public for his penchant for hiring private jets when going on foreign trips when the country is in dire economic straits. GhanaFact has been looking into one of the viral pictures shared on Facebook ( ,  ) and Twitter ( ,  ,     ,  ) to authenticate whether the photograph can be trusted.   Using Google reverse image search, GhanaFact found the original image – a master bed in a VIP private jet, Boeing BBJ3 – one of the latest and largest variants of the Boeing 737 line – shared by   a private jet industry marketplace where people go to search for aircrafts and request charter flight quotes. The original image has been used by Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa ( ) and some credible online news platforms ( ,  ,  ,   and  ) since the legislator started a campaign to demand government accounts for how much the state spends on funding the President’s travels. The original picture has since been digitally altered to show Ghana’s President, Nana Akufo-Addo seated by the bed in the jet alongside Evelyn Aidoo, aka Serwaa Broni. Using another digital tool,   – which is a web-based integrated toolset for journalists, we found that several parts of the now-viral picture seem to have been manipulated. After running the viral picture through the software’s image forensics feature, which provides an enhanced toolkit to detect image forgeries, the team looked out for the error level analysis of the image, inconsistencies that occur when foreign objects are inserted into an image, algorithmically detection of a tampered image among a number of other highlights.    is produced by recompressing the image as a JPEG of quality 75 and subtracting the new image from the old. The resulting residual is then enhanced and displayed. Areas of interest are those with higher values than other similar parts of the image. Only similar regions should be compared, i.e. edges should be compared to edges, textures to textures, and uniform regions to uniform regions. Colour discrepancies are also generally suspicious. Various areas within the image have different compression levels and likely indicates a digital modification.    occur when a foreign object is inserted in a JPEG image. When the new image is saved, the untampered part of the image will have been compressed twice, while the inserted region only once. In this case, the tampered area should appear red while the rest of the image blue. If medium values are present, then no conclusion may be made. Also, the detected region must be object-like: spurious dots scattered across the image, or (check) a globally high-valued image should be ignored. Some sections of the image are appearing red which shows the parts of the image which have been digitally altered.    operates on 8×8 grids, which are near-invisible to the naked eye but can still be algorithmically detected. Adding or moving an object on an image may locally disrupt this grid. The BLOCK algorithm detects the image grid and looks for local discrepancies. Any coherent region which contrasts with its surroundings may correspond to tampering, although high values on a low background are the most typical indication of tampering. As this algorithm is often misguided by differences in texture and focus, it is best interpreted in combination with other algorithms. The different high-contrast in texture making parts of the image appear much brighter than low-texture surfaces is prove that it has been tampered with.   Further online search has shown that the picture of President Akuffo-Addo assenting to the controversial e-levy bill was inserted into the original image to create the now-viral picture.   An aide to Vice President Mahamudu Bawumia on March 31 shared  , with the caption that  , while a number of other credible online news platforms have also used the picture in their reports ( ,  ,  ,  ).

" Viral video shows the arrest of a suspect involved in the Ablekuma robbery case  Viral video   A TikTok video showing the arrest of a young man by some police officers is being portrayed on WhatsApp as one of the armed robbers in the Ablekuma robbery incident, which occurred on June 22, 2023. The video shared on WhatsApp and tagged “forwarded many times” shows a young man with dreadlocks in the bucket of a pickup truck, surrounded by a number of police officers while some bystanders make efforts to touch him. The 31 seconds long video comes with an accompanying text: “The guy who shot and killed the policeman in the bullion van has been arrested this morning”. This fact-check report seeks to verify the accuracy of the claim.   On June 22, 2023, a four-member armed gang attacked a bullion van at a pump station at Ablekuma Fanmilk – which led to the death of a police escort assigned to guard the bullion van.

"Ghana is spending 23% of its budget on education President Nana Akufo-Addo Is Ghana currently spending 23% of its total national budget on education? That is the claim made by President Nana Akufo-Addo during a panel discussion at the Global Education Summit in London, while flanked by colleague African Heads of State from Nigeria, Kenya, Togo, and business mogul, Aliko Dangote. The two-day programme co-hosted by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta in London, brought together leaders in governments, businesses, private foundations and development banks to commit funding and support to children’s education in the world’s lowest-income countries.   “I can not see that making sure that the population is healthy and also the population is getting educated can be conflicting aims… We have to make efforts to achieve both targets and that is what we are trying to do in Ghana. We’re spending as we speak now some 23% of our budget on education. It’s one of the highest on the continent, and we intend to ramp it up even more,”   in response to a question from the moderator.   The claim has since been republished in   and attributed to the Ghanaian leader.   The total percentage of government expenditure on education is calculated by dividing total government expenditure on education by the total government expenditure on all sectors and multiplying by 100. The   and   have made reference to this methodology in their computation of the Ghana government expenditure on education (current, capital, and transfers) over the years (  and  ). Meanwhile, thirty(30) civil society organisations (CSOs) in the education sector led by Africa Education Watch have stated that “in 2021, Ghana has allocated about GHC 15.6 billion, representing 14% of total national budget to education. That’s about 4% of 2020 GDP.” This is contrary to the claim by the President that Ghana is spending 23% of its national budget on education. The CSOs position was captured in a petition sent to President Nana Akufo-Addo ahead of the Global Education Summit and published in the state-owned daily newspaper, The Daily Graphic on July 27.   “You can independently verify from the 2021 Budget presentation to ascertain how much was allocated to education. Look for the amount allocated to the Ministry of Education and you’ll see that this time around they’ve added the Free Senior High School so it is even straightforward. In previous years Free Senior High School was under the office of government machinery. But this time around it has been brought under Education Ministry so you can easily tabulate the total as a percentage of the total expenditure being allocated to the national budget,” Executive Director of Africa Education Watch told GhanaFact. Checks by GhanaFact from the   showed total allocation to the Ministry of Education was more than 15.6 billion cedis while total expenditure was also more than110 billion cedis. From the available data, total government expenditure on education is   and not   as suggested by President Akufo-Addo.     Efforts to reach the Ministry of Education to respond to our findings proved futile.

"President Nana Akufo-Addo is tired of coronavirus fight Minister of Health, Kwaku Agyeman-Manu True Ghana, like the rest of the world, has in place measures aimed at tackling the continuous spread of COVID-19. However, the country seems to be experiencing increasing numbers of confirmed coronavirus cases in recent times. But is President Nana Akufo-Addo “tired” of fighting the coronavirus outbreak? Well, that is the claim being attributed to the Health Minister, Kwaku Agyeman-Manu, in local online media reports on  ,   and  , with the story later republished by international media platform-   and shared on Twitter.   Ghana’s c  stands at 22,822, with 17,564 recoveries/discharged and 129 deaths as of July 5, according to the Ghana Health Service. This is after the country recorded its  , with the announcement made by the Health Minister, Kwaku Agyeman-Manu.   There was   when news broke that Kwaku Agyeman-Manu had been admitted at the University of Ghana Medical Center (UGMC) over fears of contracting the virus, and subsequent media reports of his  . It took the President to   that the minister had indeed contracted the virus during a national address to update Ghanaians on the coronavirus spread in Ghana. However, Deputy Health Minister Dr Bernard Okoe Boye has recently confirmed the minister’s   and discharge from hospital.   In a 2minutes long audio clip made available to GhanaFact by Starrfm.com.gh, the Minister of Health, Kwaku Agyeman-Manu is heard partly saying in his native Bono language: “If we don’t do that, the virus will continue to spread… if we are not careful, the positive cases will turn into critical illness. Nana Addo is tired. Those of us leading the fight are fatigued because we have done all that we could to defeat the virus but people are not adhering to the preventive protocols.” The Health Minister who doubles as the Member of Parliament for Dormaa Central Constituency said this at a ceremony to commission a newly built Police Station and a Community-based Health Planning and Service (CHPS) Compound in Dormaa Nsesreso.   The minister has since suggested he might have been lost in translation- walking back his earlier comments. In a   published on Peacefmonline and aggregated by  , Kwaku Agyeman-Manu is quoted to have said: “I only pleaded with Ghanaians on our normal COVID education awareness and I spoke about the hard work the President has put into this battle. The tireless efforts that the President and health officials have put into this fight require that we all help and adhere to the safety protocols. If we don’t, [it] may put the President’s labour in vain.”   The claim that the minister made the original statement is true. But to situate his comment in context considering the language barrier, the “tired” used here was to show frustration due to non-adherence of the COVID-19 protocol and not to suggest the government was giving up the fight against coronavirus outbreak.       © 2022 All rights reserved","July 10, 2020",False,FACT-CHECK: Who said President Akufo-Addo is tired of the coronavirus fight?,https://ghanafact.com/2020/07/fact-check-who-said-president-akufo-addo-is-tired-of-the-coronavirus-fight/

" 313, 837 SHS students to sit for 2020 WASSCE exams President Nana Akufo-Addo False Final year students of Senior High Schools (SHS) across Ghana are starting their three-week-long West African Senior School Certificate Exams (WASSCE) effective July 20. Despite the mounting pressure from parents and teacher unions for government to send students back home due to fears of COVID-19 spread, there seem to be no indication of that happening as Ghana’s President Nana Akufo-Addo and Deputy Education Minister, Dr Yaw Osei Adutwum have taken to Facebook to offer well wishes and good luck messages to the candidates. But the comments have generated some controversy about what the correct number of SHS candidates sitting for the 2020 WASSCE is?   With more than 110,000 followers on Facebook, Deputy Education Minister Dr Yaw Osei Adutwum said in a post on July 19 that: “In all, Three Hundred and Thirteen Thousand, Eight Hundred and Thirty-Seven (313, 837) youngsters are sitting for this year’s examinations, courtesy the Free SHS policy that created an accessible, equitable and quality education for every Ghanaian of Senior High school-going age, no matter one’s background!”   More than 10 hours after the original post, the Deputy Minister edited the number in his post to 375,737.   President Nana Akufo-Addo has also made similar claims that 313, 837 candidates were expected to take the WASSCE exams on his verified Facebook page that has more than 1.8 million followers.   But in a subsequent edit of the Facebook post, the total number was changed to 375,737.     An independent verification of the changes can be seen by viewing the edit history of the President’s post that has been shared close to 1,000 times and generated 1,400 comments at the time of writing this report.   Meanwhile, a tweet by President Nana Akufo-Addo still maintains that 313, 837 candidates were expected to take the WASSCE exams starting today. The tweet, posted on July 19 to the Presidents 1.5 million followers has generated more than 6,000 interactions and is yet to be pulled down at the time of writing this report.   GhanaFact checks on the website of the organisers of WASSCE,   show the total number of SHS students taking the exams is 375,737 and not the figure captured in the President Nana Akufo-Addo’s tweet.   Efforts to reach the Director of Communications at the Presidency, Eugene Arhin and Deputy Education Minister Dr Yaw Osei Adutwum to react to our findings have proven futile.

" Algeria declares support for Niger Coup  Viral claim Multiple social media users ( ,  ,  ,   and  ) and some online news platforms ( ,  ,  ) have shared a viral claim suggesting the government of Algeria has declared support for the Coup d’état in Niger. This follows the decision by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) leaders to impose trade and financial sanctions on Niger and further give the coup leaders up until August 7 to reinstate Niger’s democratically elected president or face the potential use of force. Already Burkina Faso, Mali and Guinea – who all have military leaders and have been suspended from the regional bloc – have dismissed the efforts by ECOWAS and declared support for the Coup in Niger.
