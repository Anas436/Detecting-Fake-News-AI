Liberia: First-time voters in Bong County Eager to make Impact in October Elections,Lennart Dodoo,"GBARNGA, Bong County – Tired and sick of economic challenges in the country, many young residents of Liberia’s centrally-located county, Bong County, are determined to collect their voter registration cards ahead of this year’s presidential and legislative elections.From the start of Phase Two of the Biometric Voter Registration process last Friday, crowds gathered at various registration centers across the county, and some would-be voters were successful but others were frustrated to be told to come back. “We need to get things right, and that is why I am taking the time and the stress to get my voter card,” said first-time voter Elijah Gwee, 19, of the Sugar Hill Community in Gbarnga.Like Elijah, young voters in the county, most of which were 11-12 years old when President George Weah came to power in 2018, are keen to go to the polls for the first time.“The older politicians keep power because the younger generation refuses to rise up, take responsibility, and hold leaders accountable. But things will be different in October,” Mary Flomo, a 19-year-old student at St. Mark’s Lutheran High School in Gbarnga.Using social media as a voice, Bong County youths told FrontPageAfrica they have identified poor infrastructure facilities and legislators who have underperformed, a collapsed health system in the country and leadership failure as major problems threatening the future of the average Liberian youth.Related Posts Full Text: Alexander Cummings’ 2023 Independence Day…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: LFA Appoints Ethiopian Selam Zeray on a Two-year…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: Armed Forces Operation Against Pirates Attack on a…  Jul 26, 2023 “Social media has provided us with the democracy we have long wanted, and we are increasingly using those platforms alongside traditional offline advocacy strategies to effect the change we see,” Abraham B. Kollie, head of the Federation of Liberian Youth (FLY) Bong County Chapter, said in a FrontPageAfrica interview.“Young people in Liberia will have the opportunity to decide the next president of Liberia. Whether it will be retaining the current government of President George Weah or electing an opposition remains to be seen” he added.Although some of the youths in the county agree that resources are thin, many believe poverty and inequality in Liberia are largely due to poor leadership and misappropriation of resources. There is extreme hunger in the country, one youth told FrontPageAfrica.“I should be happy, but I’m not happy because the current standard of living is not inspiring,” said Famata Sheriff, a resident of Gbarnga, who plans to vote for the first time.Famata said she had hoped at least one of the two major political parties would have candidates she found inspiring. “I’m casting my vote so I can decide my future.”Picking up her card in Gbartala, Yellequelleh District, first-time voter Quaper Blackie, said the culture in her district is accepting cash from politicians rather than choosing their preferred candidate. But he is determined to have his say this year. “I won’t fall for money,” she said. “I will vote my future because I have understood enough for myself and money won’t change my decision.”Participation in Liberian elections is typically low, but political analysts say the country’s economic woes, including rising insecurity, may push more people to vote, especially young people.“I want to vote for the best leader because we need to get a good choice,” Barbara Cooper, a student of St. Martin Catholic School, said. “The standard of living is poor; we don’t earn as much as when the economy is good.” ",26/04/2023,https://frontpageafricaonline.com/politics/liberia-first-time-voters-in-bong-county-eager-to-make-impact-in-october-elections/,1

The bridge was also very narrow, but now, as you can see, you can move in and out. The bridge is with concrete and since then, we have not experienced any accidents.”Madam Massa Johnson, Chairlady for Guies’ Town said, “The bridge in 1990, the people laid some things on it. It was bad at that time. Before that time, when it rains, the water can overflow and come near the town. Some of us were by the water vein and started to park our things to get outside. When Western Cluster came, they tried their best, and today, it is all right now. When water overflow, it cannot affect us anymore. We tell Western Cluster thank you.

Liberia: Sen. Prince Johnson Warns Pres. Weah against Dismissing Nimbaians from Government,Jaheim T. Tumu,"Paynesville City – Senator Prince Y. Johnson, the self-proclaimed godfather of Nimba County, says President George M. Weah has threatened to dismiss Nimbaian officials (natives of Nimba County) appointed in his government if they fail to pledge support to his second-term bid for the presidency.Senator Johnson disclosed that it would be President Weah’s greatest political disappointment if he dismisses Nimbaian officials because of a lack of support for the Coalition for Democratic Change. Senator Johnson, a long-time ally of President Weah who supported the incumbent President during the 2017 elections, previously accused the Weah-led government of plotting an assassination attempt on his life.He, however, said that his lack of support for Weah ahead of the October 10 polls is due to his government’s multiple corruption allegations, mischievous deaths, and other issues that remain unsolved.In an interview on Friday at his residence in Paynesville, Sen. Johnson said Nimbaians must stand their ground against the threats of the Liberian Leader.Related Posts Full Text: Alexander Cummings’ 2023 Independence Day…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: LFA Appoints Ethiopian Selam Zeray on a Two-year…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: Armed Forces Operation Against Pirates Attack on a…  Jul 26, 2023 According to the Nimba Senator, President Weah, who accused him of being a killer and blackmailer, tried to contact him, but he has refused to adhere to their demands.Said Senator Johnson, “What they are doing now, they are contacting Reginald Mahn, who they made County Chairman, and the President himself. I have said to those officials, if you don’t support me, if you don’t give me resolution, I will dismiss you.”Adding, “So they got to me yesterday at the Ministerial Complex from 3 pm to 10:30 last night; they were in that meeting. What to do, how do we go about this. The President has threatened to dismiss us. So they told me, I called you to let them know all Nimbaians must stand their ground. Let Mr. Weah dismiss you.”“I was told he dismissed the County inspector, the City Mayor, the Statutory Superintendent. Let him dismiss them, and we will stand our ground, and he will get the major political disappointment in this country.”Senator Johnson, who promised that Nimba will never support, indicated that those Nimbaians who have recently rallied support for Weah in Monrovia City are doing so because of the money attached to the process.“Nimba County has tradition, I will turn Nimba to you. Nimba is not a bully goat that someone can just take over. The two top Senators, including the father (Senator Johnson) of the county, they want to hear from me, so I call on all of them to join behind ‘rescue one’ (Joseph N. Boakai) and support whoever he will pick.” ",21/04/2023,https://frontpageafricaonline.com/news/liberia-sen-prince-johnson-warns-pres-weah-against-dismissing-nimbaians-from-government/,1

Charles Walker Brumskine and a Representative aspirant in the ensuing presidential and legislative elections has dragged to court a Pastor for entering her generator room without permission and using disparaging words against her late father.By Obediah JohnsonPastor Moses D. S. M. Togar of the Divine Revelation Ministry was sued at the Magisterial Court in Buchanan City by Cllr. Charlyn Brumskine, who is also contesting the Representative seat of electoral district # 3 in Grand Bassa County.The defendant is also the Principal of the Willie Peters Junior High School and Head of the Kpain ma-gbo (Help Yourself), a local community-based group in the county.He has been accused of allegedly committing the crimes of criminal trespass, criminal mischief, criminal coercion, harassment and disorderly conduct.In a writ of arrest issued by directive of the Magistrate of the court James B. Kaba, Sr., a copy which is in possession of FrontPageAfrica, Cllr. Brumskine claimed that on the 18th day of February 2023 at about 4PM in Upper Buchanan while having a reunion with her family members and community dwellers, the defendant (Pastor Togar) with “criminal intent knowingly, purposely, unlawfully and intentional entered therein without any color of right the home of the Private Prosecutrix (Cllr Brumskine) when he was not invited to be there.”The court document claimed that he allegedly “threatened” Cllr Brumskine saying that “she’s a small girl and that you will break her wings.”“The Private Prosecutrix further says that you were spotted in her generator room when in fact you have no business being there and also were noticed taking photograph of her persons and her yard,” the document further alleged.It revealed that Pastor Togar further went to a local radio station in the county and allegedly maligned the character of Counselor Brumskine by saying that, she ordered her security to “beat” on him, bringing her to public ridicule.The document alleged the defendant also referred to Counselor Brumskine and her late father as a “good for nothing person and that she has followed footsteps in the same manner and form.”The writ disclosed that the alleged acts committed by Pastor Togar is in violation of Sections 15.21, 15.5, 14.27, 14.28 and 17.5 of the new penal law of Liberia.The defendant speaksPrior to the filing of a lawsuit, Pastor Togar told Ablee-Jay Online television on February 20 that Counselor Brumskine invited residents of Upper and Central Buchanan communities to a reconciliation meeting at her residence.He said as a leader and founder of a school and ministry in one of the communities, he decided to attend the called meeting, along with other family members including his daughter and mother-in-law.Pastor Togar termed as “false and misleading” the allegation raised by Counselor Brumskine that he was caught in her generator room.“I did not enter the generator room.

A system or the security guards that photographing was strictly prohibited at the event.“I went as far as holding the guy foot and telling him sorry (for taking photos). As a sound leader, I agreed with him so that the photos can be deleted. I stood with him and gave him my phone and the photos were deleted. Moreover, somebody came and say ‘it looks like this man is a spy for Matthew Joe.’ After they accused me, they began to kicked and slapped in my b**t and face.”He claimed that his phone was also seized by the attackers.He said though he has invited the incumbent lawmaker at his church and school programs, he has not officially supported his bid.Pastor Togar further accused Counselor Brumskine of “talking the law into her own hands” by going through his phone without any authorization after it was confiscated and handed to her.“If I were guilty of taking photos t that particular gathering, what they supposed to do was to take me to the law and the law will execute the command. While I was asking her and I went to her feet to ask her for my phone, she ordered her boys including Lion and the rest of the people to get me out and started saying ‘these are the spies of Matthew Joe.’ ”He claimed to have left the scene by boarding a commercial motorcycle.He described his alleged meted against him based upon the alleged order of Counselor Brumskine as “inhumane,” adding that, “she ordered her boys to beat me unmercifully and my phone left in her possession and the amount of US$500 I have for my community-based organization was taken while I was beaten.”Related Posts Liberia: LFA Appoints Ethiopian Selam Zeray on a Two-year…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: Armed Forces Operation Against Pirates Attack on a…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: President Weah Issues Proclamation Calling the 54th…  Jul 25, 2023 Pastor Togar wondered why his decision to photograph a political event was misconstrued by the Representative aspirant and some of her supporters.Meanwhile, hearing into the case filed against the Liberian Pastor has been scheduled for Tuesday, March 28.Counselor Brumskine’s responseSpeaking in an interview with FrontPageAfrica via telephone, Counselor Brumskine denied ordering her supporters to brutalize the Pastor.She doubted that the Liberian Clergyman had in his possession the amount of US$500 when he went to her premises.According to her, Pastor Togar’s phone is in the custody of the police.“We had him in the generator room to take pictures. We have messages where he was sending Matthew Joe’s people talking about how my father and great grandfather were congau people and they treat other people like country bitches. He said ‘we have to break this lil girl’s wings’. This is not even a Pastor. When we called the police and the police arrested the man; now Matthew Joe and his people are going from journalist to journalist to paint me as a bad person.”“He was taking pictures and sending messages about me; we confiscated his phone and turned it over to the police. He was never touched and we have hundreds of witnesses who were among us and will love to testify.”Counselor Brumskine further denied receiving calls from some religious leaders in the county to withdraw the case from the court.She, however, vowed to take the lead by engaging the office of the County Attorney to withdraw the matter if Pastor Togar renders an open apology.“I have always said that if this man issues an apology, because he did not just do this to me but the public-and say that he will not engage into this activity again, I will go to the state myself and ask the County Attorney to drop the matter.”Speaking further, Cllr. Brumskine alleged that supporters of the lawmaker are bent on victimizing his perceived political opponents ahead of the elections.She claimed that one of the supporters of the incumbent stormed her office with a knife and a “rubber gun” threatening to allegedly burn her building and a truck on Saturday, March 25.FrontPageAfrica has identified the suspect as one Chris McGill. He is expected to appear in court today to answer to multiple charges.Counselor Brumskine pointed out that her decision to institute lawsuits against supporters of the incumbent is intended to uphold the rule of law.“If we are serious about changing our county and country, we cannot allow these things to happen. Everyone knows that I am a peaceful person.”She said as a person who is regarded for promoting the rule of law and order in Liberia, she will not sit and allow the incumbent and his supporters to tarnish her reputation for political gains.Wrong political calculation?The lawsuit has divided citizens of Buchanan, Grand Bassa County.Many persons are wondering while Counselor Brumskine will file legal suits against her constituents, including a Pastor for freely expressing himself.The citizens believed that as the elections draw nearer, the latest action taken by Counselor Brumskine has the propensity of discouraging residents of the county from casting their votes in her favor.They hold the view that as a seasoned lawyer, the daughter of Counselor Charles Walker Brumskine will continue to file multiple lawsuits against her constituents for minor offenses when she is declared the winner of the election.On the other hand, others believed that the lawsuits filed against Pastor Togar and McGill were in the right direction.According to them, the legal action would serve as deterrence to residents of the district and Liberia at large to desist from maligning the character and reputation of people who they do not support during this electioneering period.It remains unclear why religious leaders in the district could not amicably resolve the matter prior to the institution of the lawsuit.However, the race for the Representative seat in electoral district # 3 in Grand Bassa County seems to be getting politically charge ahead of the pronouncement of the campaign period for the ensuing elections.Liberians are expected to go to the polls to elect their new leaders on October 10 this year, according to a timetable released by the National Elections Commission (NEC).

"Prominent Cape Mount Citizen Dr. Zoedua Denounces Protest in Western Liberia, Calls for Dialogue",Contributing Writer,"MONROVIA – The Chair of the Marvoh Elders Council in Grand Cape Mount County, Dr. Edwin Zoedua has in the strongest term denounced any form of protest against Bea Mountain Mining Company (BMMC).Marvoh is the land Bea Mountain has its operations and the people of the area are the custodians of the land. Recently, report leaked to the media says citizens of the area are planning a mass demonstration against the BMMC. Speaking to a team of reporters over the weekend in Grand Cape Mount County, Dr. Zoedua clarified that he has not sat in any meeting for the planning of any protest action as reported to be organized by a group under the banner, Western Region Solidarity Movement.He stressed that even though he cannot form part of an action that he knows nothing about, it is ridiculous and unnecessary for any group to engage in a protestation at the moment.“Protest does not help at all. If some people are dissatisfied, they should sit with the relevant people to dialogue,” he said.The Chairman termed those organizing such protests against the BMMC as a bunch of uneducated folks who are bent on misinforming and misinterpreting the good workings of the community.He questioned the intent of the protest from a group he claimed failed ‘massively’ to live up to a contract given them by the company but wants to embark on what he called a sentimental and fruitless fight.He further expressed disappointment in the attitude of the community leaders. Those local leaders have not been sincere to themselves and the Bea Mountain Mining Company, he said.The Chairman of the Marvoh Elders Council stressed that the insincerity of the community leaders is driving the county on a slow developmental path.Related Posts Liberia: Minister Sonii Extols Bea Mountain for Constructing…  Jul 22, 2023 Liberia: Man, 26, Arrested With Huge Ammunition in Ganta  Jul 3, 2023 Liberia: CDC Nominates U.S. Sanctioned Nathaniel McGill as…  Jun 30, 2023 He believes if the sub-contractors are honest to themselves by completing whatever arranged contract, instead of blaming the company, it would serve the best interest of everyone.Dr. Zoedua also said whenever the company provides loans for the community, sometimes five or six individuals covertly siphoned such money and blamed the Bea Mountain Mining Company.He noted that the company is doing its best for the citizens, but stressed that the Community Relations of the entity need to educate the citizens more.“Look, let’s be an honest man and this is why we’re having problems in this place. Because you got these so-called uneducated characters here creating problems for us.”“Oh, so you took the money, I’m not going to call too many names because we’re trying to break this thing together called the ‘Class Action’ soon and I will be in front,” Dr. Zoedua averred.According to him, those there are people who took the contract from the Bea Mountain Mining Company to fix chairs and tables for a school in the area but upon fixing those materials, the chairs and tables could not stand by themselves.He indicated that the so-called group planning a protest should rethink their decision and focus on their missteps.Meanwhile, the Chair of the Marvoh Elders Council in Grand Cape Mount County is recommending a constant dialogue and negotiation to find an amicable solution to whatever dispute.While suggesting a dialogue, Dr. Edwin Zoedua also called on the management of Bea Mountain Mining Company to create a hotline through which citizens can channel their grievances and other concerns.He further proposed a workshop to be conducted by the company for the community dwellers, something he believes will help the BMMC to adequately educate the entire citizenry about its operations, including short and long-term plans for the people.

Marvin Cole, Bong County Health Team Staff Linked to the Disappearance of US$107,176.00 Meant for Clinic in Bong Town",Selma Lomax,"Gbondoi, Bong County – Residents of Gbondoi Town in Bong County Electoral District Six on Friday took to the streets to protest District Three Representative Marvin Cole’s decision to divert US$ 25,000,00 earmarked during the 2020 Fiscal Year for a clinic in their district to the Kpayah Clinic in his district.By Selma Lomax,[emailprotected]In the last three years, $107,176.00 has been allocated in the national budget for a clinic in Gbondoi, but there has been no clinic construction, FrontPageAfrica tour of the town established.The Kpayah Health Center, being constructed by Rep. Cole, has also received $100,000,00 from the national budget for the past three fiscal years.In a letter addressed to Deputy Health Minister Norwu Howard dated March 16, 2020, Cole asked that $25,000 of the $50,000 earmarked for Gbondoi clinic be transferred to Kpayah Health Center.The citizens organized a protest after they learned that Rep. Cole raised a motion last week Thursday in Plenary on the 2023-2024 budget for an additional $25,000,00 for the clinic.In his motion, Cole told the Plenary that the clinic when completed would boost healthcare delivery in the town and nearby villages.However, Representative Moima Briggs Mensah of District Six, rejected the motion, stating that there was clinic being constructed in Gbondoi by Rep. Cole, despite allotments of over $100,000,00 in previous budget years.“No clinic has been constructed in Gbondoi by Honorable Cole, despite previous budgetary allotments,’ Briggs Mensah said. “He wants additional money for an invisible clinic. We are into electioneering period, so some of our colleagues who are going for re-election want to exploit their own people to raise money for their re-election.’’Rep. Mensah urged Cole to give account of what he did with the previous funds for the clinic. “Rep. Cole should tell the people what he has done with previous funds that had been allocated for the construction of the Gbondoi clinic rather than denying there is a construction of a health center from the national budget.”Since the election of President George Weah in 2018, residents of Gbondoi have been advocating for a clinic to serve their community of 5,000 inhabitants.Related Posts Full Text: Alexander Cummings’ 2023 Independence Day…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: LFA Appoints Ethiopian Selam Zeray on a Two-year…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: Armed Forces Operation Against Pirates Attack on a…  Jul 26, 2023 No clinic, no votingThe protesters said they wanted to alert everyone, including Rep.

Liberia: Sen. Varney Sherman Says Fellow Senator Lied on Him Over Diverting Money Given to Grand Cape Mount County,Henry Karmo,"MONROVIA – Senator Varney Sherman (UP-Grand Cape Mount County) has denied the allegations made by his colleague, Senator Simon Taylor (ANC-Grand Cape Mount County), calling them false and misguided comments. He also referred to Senator Taylor as a “coincidental colleague.”By Henry Karmo, [emailprotected]Last week, Senator Taylor accused Senator Johnson and other members of the county legislative caucus of individualizing approximately US$2 million dollars that was paid to the county by mining company, Bea Mountain. Senator Taylor also accused Senator Sherman of doing nothing for the people of Bomi since his election over nine years ago.Related Posts Full Text: Alexander Cummings’ 2023 Independence Day…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: LFA Appoints Ethiopian Selam Zeray on a Two-year…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: Armed Forces Operation Against Pirates Attack on a…  Jul 26, 2023 In response, Senator Sherman dismissed Senator Taylor’s accusations and stated that they were based on an erroneous assumption. According to Senator Sherman, Senator Taylor falsely assumed that the contribution from Bea Mountain was only for the Gola Konneh District, his original district, since that is where the gold is extracted. Senator Sherman clarified that other districts and localities are entitled to a portion of the contribution as well.Senator Sherman explained that after members of the County Caucus, including local county officials, secured the contribution from Bea Mountain for the fiscal years 2013 through 2020, the Grand Cape Mont Legislative caucus, the superintendent, and the two assistant superintendents agreed that Gola Konneh District should receive 25% upfront, and the balance of 75% should be divided among all the districts.He further elaborated that under their plan, Gola Konneh District would receive an additional 14% due to its size and population density, while Porkpa District would receive 13%, Tewor and Garwulu District would receive 12%, and other smaller communities would receive smaller percentages. Senator Sherman emphasized that Gola Konneh District would receive a total of 39% of the entire contribution from Bea Mountain, which was more than what was provided for most directly affected communities in Nimba County, Grand Bassa County, and Bong County.Regarding the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), Senator Sherman explained that it was agreed that installment payments would be made to an account at a bank within three days of the execution of the MOU. Bea Mountain selected the International Bank (Liberia), and the amount in that account was supposed to be US$775,000.00. Section 19d) of the Mineral Development Agreement provides that the contribution shall be managed by a 10-man committee, with five members from Bea Mountain and five from the government. Bea Mountain named its five persons in the MOU, with the understanding that the other five would be named later.The MOU provides that all decisions of this committee shall be made by at least six persons, three from each side. Senator Sherman clarified that the Liberian government did not use the US$100,000.00 contribution made by Bea Mountain for the development project in Cape Mount. Therefore, Bea Mountain welcomed their proposition that they (Cape Mount Leadership) would submit the names of five persons to represent Cape Mount.

Liberia: The Farmer Defending His Land Against A Palm Plantation,Contributing Writer,"Saturday Wilson has defended his farmland against the Maryland Oil Palm Plantation (MOPP) for nearly 13 years. The DayLight/James Harding GiahyuePLEEBO, Maryland County – One day in 2016 policemen arrested Saturday Wilson at his farm. Wilson had been accused by the Maryland Oil Palm Plantation (MOPP) of stealing fertilizers, a court document shows.By James Harding Giahyue, with The DayLightWilson spent two days in a police cell and after a relatively short case, the Pleebo Magisterial Court sentenced him to three and a half months in prison. It said he prevented the company from clearing the land the government had leased to it.“I told [the judge], ‘For me, I am not embarrassing the concession but that is my land,’” Wilson tells The DayLight at his home in Gewloken in the Gbolobo Chiefdom of Pleebo Sodoken District.“I will serve my sentence but when I come, the land will remain there. I will meet it there. It will still be for me.”That was not Wilson’s first ordeal with MOPP, and not his last either. In the last 13 years, the 47-year-old farmer has been embroiled in a battle with the company over his farmland. It has placed him behind bars three times. However, he still owns the land.MOPP had come to Pleebo in 2010 and began clearing some 15,200 hectares of land ahead of itsagreementwith the Liberian government. Many people, including some of Wilson’s relatives,lost their villages, farmlands, ancestral graveyards and shrines. The following year, MOPP signed an agreement worth US$203 million for 25 years, stretching as far as Grand Kru.But Wilson would beat all odds to defend the remaining portion of his ancestral land. His family and the people of Gewloken had lost a huge swathe of land toDecoris Oil Palm Company, a previous Ivory Coast-based firm that operated in that region from 1980 to 1987. As a matter of fact, MOPP inherited the ruins of Decoris’ plantation as the result of Liberia’s first and second civil wars.This Drone photograph shows Gewleken, Saturday Wilson’s hometown, engulfed by Maryland Oil Palm Plantation. The DayLight/Derick SnyderWilson was a teenager back then but still remembers how Decoris wiped out his Gewloken town. Several generations of the Wilson clan had lived on the land as far back as the 1800s when Maryland was aterritory in Africa. In 1978, tribal chiefs and elders presented the family with a paper for the land, seen by The DayLight. In those days, customary land rights were not recognized but people were issued tribal certificates as a process leading to a formal title. Decoris, however, did not recognize that document. Now a full-grown man, Wilson could not afford to lose an inch of the land once more. “As a child when you coming up that land becomes part of you,” says the father of six. Wilson’s first encounter with MOPP happened in October 2010. MOPP had sent workers to clear land they claim is part of its concession area. They destroyed banana shrubs and rice stalks on his farm. Still haunted by memories of Decoris’ land grab, Wilson was furious. A scuffle ensued, with men from Gewloken joining the fray.Then the police arrived on the scene. “They went and arrested us, we were 16 persons, took us to Harper,” Wilson recalls. “So, after two days we were released.” After that encounter, Wilson and MOPP tried to resolve their issue but it would only lead to more tension. Bowing to pressure from some of his relatives, friends and local officials, Wilson agreed to give up his land with the agreement that MOPP would compensate him for his crops. In 2015, MOPP counted some of the crops on his farmland but abandoned the process after the first day, according to Wilson. His half-torn handwritten record of the count shows 2,259 plantain shrubs, 327 palm trees and 25 pineapple plants. Though frustrated over the failed crops compensation deal with MOPP, Wilson remained calm. In fact, he regretted having agreed to give out the land in the first place. Nearly all of the people who started the advocacy with him five years ago had given in. The ones in MOPP’s employ complained of alleged bad labor practices, including low wages.This photograph shot with a drone shows Gewloken, the hometown of Saturday Wilson, just next to the Maryland Oil Palm Plantation. The DayLight/Derick Snyder“I wanted to compromise with them… because of the tension,” Wilson says. “I am looking at other things to come. It’s better to maintain my piece of land than to work with the company. So, I am not willing to give it.”After Wilson returned from prison, he sought permission from the court to get back to his farm.Related Posts Full Text: Alexander Cummings’ 2023 Independence Day…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: LFA Appoints Ethiopian Selam Zeray on a Two-year…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: Armed Forces Operation Against Pirates Attack on a…  Jul 26, 2023 The court arranged a hearing between Wilson and the company’s legal team. Then came the big news: MOPP told the court they had no land case with him, according to Wilson. The DayLight could not verify that claim. Wesley Kortor, the magistrate of the Pleebo Magisterial Court said it could not locate the case file due to a burglary incident. Efforts to obtain the documents from MOPP and Wilson did not materialize.Wilson returned to his farm, happy that his struggles with MOPP were over, but his celebration would be short-lived once more. On Friday, June 8, 2018, MOPP workers made away with 180 bunches of palm nuts Wilson had harvested. He filed a complaint with MOPP’s community liaison committee, a body set up by the company to look into community grievances. It has been crucial in restoring calm to the region after MOPP’s controversial deal with the Liberian government.The Pleebo Magisterial Court, where Saturday Wilson was tried and convicted for stealing Maryland Oil Palm Plantation’s fertilizers. The DayLight/James Harding Giahyue“I am therefore using this medium to register these cases to your office and request your timely intervention and [a] peaceful resolution,” Wilson said in the complaint to Olando Karbeh, the chairperson of the committee. He was citing an incident just a month before where an MOPP staff took 40 of Wilson’s palm bunches, according to his handwritten letter featuring witnesses from the company, seen by The DayLight.Kouakou Bah, MOPP’s general manager at the time, accused Wilson of harvesting the palm nuts on MOPP’s side of their boundary. During the proceedings, Wilson argued that MOPP unilaterally demarcated boundaries. (Communities’ participation is a key concept in the global oil palm industry.) An investigation by the community liaison committee and county officials found Wilson was right, according to Karbeh. However, MOPP did not return Wilson’s harvests nor gave him any compensation. After that controversy, Wilson planted plantain trees on the widely accepted boundary between his 25-acre farm and the plantation to avert any future harvest rows.While that move has protected his estimated 2,000 palm trees, his relationship with MOPP has remained frosty within the last six years. In a meeting late last year with county officials and citizens, MOPP representative complained about Wilson’s farmland, people, who attended the meeting, say. “In the meeting, they said they were having problem with Saturday Wilson,” says Thomas Wilson, his brother and paramount chief for the Klebo Chiefdom under which Gewloken falls.“The City Mayor in Pleebo Wellington Kyne came out and said ‘Saturday is not with us in here… maybe he has something to say.’“I said in the meeting that the land that Saturday has is not even for him. It is for the.. Gewloken community,” Thomas Wilson adds in an interview at his home. Kyne corroborates his account in a phone interview.The Community Liaison Committee has asked MOPP to resolve its conflict with Wilson more than once but the company declined, says Karbeh, calling for an end to more than a decade of hostilities.It does not stop there. MOPP has refused to recognize him as a local palm farmer, also called a smallholder or an out-grower in the industry worldwide. The Maryland Oil Palm Outgrower Association has disclosed MOPP would begin purchasing local farmers’ harvests soon but Wilson is excluded, despite being a member of the group. He sells his harvests to Sopalm, a company more than 40 kilometers away in the Ivory coast, based on a receipt seen by The DayLight. He fears it would not change even if local farmers begin selling to MOPP.Kwia Nelson, the president of the association, says MOPP is retaliating against Wilson. “It seems to be that human being heart will never leave things, so MOPP looks at it that the area is still for the company so at the end of the day they don’t want to do business with him,” Nelson tells The DayLight in an interview at his home in Pleeboy City.“That is the information I have gathered as head [of the association].”Saturday Wilson stands at the boundary between his farmland and the Maryland Oil Palm Plantation (MOPP). It covers 25 acres and has about 2,000 palm trees, according to Wilson. The DayLight/James Harding GiahyueOutgrowers are crucial to MOPP’s concession with Liberia and the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), which sets the standards for the global industry. The concession agreement requires MOPP to buy outgrowers’ palm bunches at a set price and quality, among other things. The RSPO mandates its members to include smallholders in their development plans. Is one of seven principles the watchdog operates on. MOPP is Owned by theSIFCA Group, an Ivory Coast-based firm owned by the Singaporean multinationalWilmar International, a member of the RSPO.James Otto, a lead campaigner at the Sustainable Development Institute (SDI) that advocates for the rights of communities adjacent to the plantation, praises Wilson for defending his rights. Otto says Wilson’s ordeals discourage smallholder farming but show that people can stand up against powerful investors.“Saturday needs to be a hero,” Otto tells The DayLight in Monrovia of Wilson, who is captured in anew reportby SDI. “I call him the hero of the southeast.” MOPP did not respond to a set of questions The DayLight emailed to them nearly two weeks ago.Funding for this story was provided by the Green Livelihood Alliance (GLA 2.0) through the Community Rights and Corporate Governance Program of the Sustainable Development Institute (SDI).

Liberia: As Schools Outsourcing Experiment Falters Teachers Say It’s Time to Give Counties Control?,Eric Opa Duoe,"In part two of this two-part series with New Narratives Eric Opa Doue finds widespread opposition from teachers and civil society to government’s privatization of schools and a plea to government to abandon the scheme and let counties take charge.YARPAH TOWN, River Cess County – Emmanuel Yarbah squeezes onto a desk next to a classmate here in Togar Macintosh school. With a bare dirt floor and no ceiling, it is swelteringly hot. There are about 17 children in the classroom but only ten old desks. Not that it really matters. Even if it were a good setting for learning, there are no teachers.Report by Eric Opa Doue with New NarrativesFive of eleven teachers assigned to this school, which has been run by US-based for-profit Bridge International since 2016, school laid down their chalk in 2021 demanding salaries they say government owes them. The school is now being run by the vice principal for administration and four teachers. Many of the problems such as poor teacher training and no teaching materials have been laid at the feet of Bridge but the government is not meeting its obligations either.“The government is disappointing us,” says Sam Farley, head of the Parent Teachers Association here. “How will a principal be teaching in the school, that man will come here from 7:30am to 4 he will be on the school campus, then you go put ‘hold’ to the man check? Now our children now suffering. Not only the principal, but the other people also are not taking pay. All the teachers that came here, all of them gone and it affect us a lot.”The problems were the same in all Bridge schools visited by FPA/New Narratives in River Cess, Grand Bassa, Lofa and rural Montserrado. Critics of the Sirleaf government’s radical 2016 plan to outsource the education sector say they are not surprised by the outcome. The Center for Transparency and Accountability in Liberia (CENTAL), the accountability civil society organization then headed by Thomas Nah, (now head of the Liberian Revenue Authority) was a vocal opponent. Anderson Miamen, the current Cental head, says there is no quick fix to Liberia’s education problems. It needs serious investment and higher teacher salaries than the $150 a month on average they are currently paid.Miamen says government should have increased education spending to at least 20 percent of the country’s budget. (In 2022 the entire education system – primary through tertiary – received $92.3m or 11.7 per cent of the total budget.) Miamen says the government should decentralize the sector by creating and supporting county school boards.“We need to fix the public school system in a holistic way. Everybody needs to have an equal chance of accessing quality education,” says Miamen. “And the way to do it is not to introduce a program that will be discriminatory in terms of how it is rolled out. We don’t need a partner that will shield information from the communities, from the school authorities and even from the students, so that they cannot demand what is theirs.”Miamen says teacher training institutes in places like Maryland, Kakata and Lofa are training too few teachers. “So, you still have major, major gaps when it comes to trained and qualified. But then when you train the teachers you also have to motivate them. They have to be handsomely rewarded for their services. You have to create the enabling environment for them to move to the counties.”CENTAL’s Executive Director, Anderson Miamen: Photo by Eric Opa Doue.Attracting and retaining good teachers has been a major challenge in all of the rural schools visited by FPA/New Narratives in this investigation – whether they were part of LEAP or not. In many cases teachers had left simply because the government had never managed to get them onto the payroll system.Togar Macintosh was one of the first 23 schools given to Bridge in 2016 with promises of a big turnaround. Six years on that turnaround has never arrived. Buildings are crumbling, there aren’t enough teachers and Bridge is yet to supply teaching materials.The Memorandum of Understanding between the Government and Bridge stipulated that Bridge was to provide training for teachers and as well learning materials, while government was responsible for maintenance of the schools. Neither side was living up to their side of the deal at the Bridge controlled schools visited by NN/FPA during this investigation.“They can just come on the campus at time and promise,” says Moses Gbah, Vice Principal for Administration at Togar MacIntosh. “But we don’t know what is unfolding that they have not started with the maintenance of the school building.”Moses Gbah is the Vice Principal for Administration at Togar Macintosh (Bridge) School in River Cess: Photo by Eric Opa DoueRelated Posts Full Text: Alexander Cummings’ 2023 Independence Day…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: LFA Appoints Ethiopian Selam Zeray on a Two-year…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: Armed Forces Operation Against Pirates Attack on a…  Jul 26, 2023 One of the leaking classrooms at Sarah Sampson George (Bridge) School in Buchanan, Grand Bassa County: Photo by Eric Opa DoueNeither the Ministry of Education nor Bridge agreed to interviews for this article. After a series of broken appointment dates, Maxim Bleetem, head of communication at the Ministry of Education, referred this reporter to Gbovadeh Gbilia, Bridge’s Executive Director. In a WhatsApp chat Gbilia wrote that Bridge schools are the best in the country.“Well, you are telling me about teachers and CSOs and putting story in FrontPage,” Gbilia wrote. “Of course schools are dissatisfied with one thing or another. It’s one sided if you aren’t balancing it with schools that are praising us for our interventions. Especially the many, many Bridge schools who have 100% pass rate from the recently released 3rd and 6th grades WEAC results.” Gbilia referred this reporter to Barkedu Public School in Lofa as an example of Bridge success.However, FPA/New Narratives found the same problems at Barkedu. According to Principal Allieu V. Dulleh Barkedu has teacher shortages and limited teaching materials. Of 12 teachers in the school, the principal says only three are on the government’s payroll. The rest are volunteers.“Before Bridge took over, there were five government teachers,” said Dulleh by mobile phone. “So, out of the five, one person was retired by the government, and one other person was deleted from the payroll and up till now he has not been put back.”Dulleh said textbooks supplied by Bridge are not in line with the Liberian curriculum so teachers have to find their own materials to prepare students. Dulleh rejected Gbilia’s claim about students’ West Africa Examination Council results. No third graders from his school sat the WAEC exams because parents could not afford the fees. Despite the limited materials, Dulleh says, 14 out of 15 sixth graders who sat the test passed successfully. He says that was because of the extra efforts by teachers, not because of Bridge.“The way we do it required a thorough research by the staff and the school administration,” said Dulleh. “Because we need to make sure that those necessary materials, we get to other schools to get some of the materials to go the children.”4th Grade class at Togar Macintosh in Centra River Cess District: Photo by Eric Opa DoueSome government-run public schools performed well in the WEAC with no external support. For instance, 50 students from Bassa Demonstration School in Buchanan – in the same compound with Bridge school Sarah Sampson George – and 26 students from Gbediah Public School in Central River Cess all passed successfully.Principal Peter Gargar, of Gbediah Public School, is president of the River Cess branch of the National Teachers’ Association Liberia (NTAL). He also says there is no need for LEAP. “The non-LEAP schools’ students are performing well as compared to their LEAP counterparts,” says Gargar. “That is because what they are teaching the children is different. They are not going by the curriculum.”Teachers have been opposed to LEAP from the start. In April 2020 the NTAL and eleven civil society organizations, joined with teacher organizations from Kenya, Nigeria, South African and Uganda to petition government to abandon LEAP.“Lack of independent evidence, transparency, and accountability,” on the part of government and the providers were among issues raised in the petition. But Samuel Johnson, Secretary General of the NTAL, says till now the government is yet to respond.Johnson agrees with Cental’s Miamen that the system should be put in the hands of counties.“Every county get their own school system and they pay teachers according to qualification,” says Johnson. “They do continual professional development to train people who are already in their area. When you improve all of these things, as it is done in our neighboring countries, the sector will improve.”For now, students like Yarbah are paying a price for failures in Liberia’s education system. And another generation of students risks being left behind.This two-part series was a collaboration with New Narratives as part of the Investigating Liberia project.

Liberia: Jailed President Charles Taylor’s Birthday Passes Unnoticed In Gbarnga,Selma Lomax,"BONG COUNTY – Former Liberian president Charles Taylor on Saturday, January 28 celebrated his 75th birthday, but his natal day appeared to have gone unnoticed in Bong County, where he served as rebel leader in the 1990s.Taylor’s admirers have always celebrated his birthday in Bong County since he was sentenced to a 50-year jail sentence in the United Kingdom for aiding and abetting rebels in neighboring Sierra Leone during the 1991-2002 civil war.By Selma Lomax, [emailprotected]However, many of these admirers this year refused to throw up a party as they did in the past, blaming it on the current economic hardship.Jerry Forkpah, lex-fighter of Taylor’s former army the Anti Terrorist Unit, who has always made January 28 his personal holiday, said though the former Liberian president still holds a place in his heart, he was more concerned about his livelihood than celebrating a man he says won’t return to Liberia anytime soon.“I celebrated Taylor’s birthday in the past because I had faith he would one day return, but it has been more than 15 years since he was jailed and there are no signs he will return,” he said.“Feeding in Liberia today is not easy as food, which is a basic need, has become a difficult for the ordinary people like us. Prices of foodstuffs are now triple the prices they were before and they increase daily without control,” says Martin Kamara, 43, who spent all his youthful days in Gbarnga during Taylor revolution. “Our prayers are with.”Related Posts Full Text: Alexander Cummings’ 2023 Independence Day…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: LFA Appoints Ethiopian Selam Zeray on a Two-year…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: Armed Forces Operation Against Pirates Attack on a…  Jul 26, 2023 “You go to the market with a substantial amount of money, but you end up asking yourself what you bought because your shopping bag appears to be empty.

Almost 19,000 of them were killed, enslaved, raped and tortured—among other crimes.Over 22,000 human rights violations were committed in Bong County as a whole, the second highest number of violations, behind Montserrado County. The TRC recommended more than a decade ago that Taylor face a war crimes court for Liberia over the crimes his group committed in the country.Taylor’s forces committed 41 per cent of the crimes committed during the war and recorded by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), the highest number of any faction.Taylor had formed the National Patriotic Reconstruction Assembly Government (NPRAG) in Bong’s capital Gbargna, after his Christmas Day invasion into Nimba from Ivory Coast in 1989.Taylor envisaged a future Liberian capital be moved in Bong County from Monrovia, a call that resonated with people in the county. It was from there that Taylor launched attacks on rival warring factions in the southeastern, northern and western parts of the country.Bong County is the stronghold of the National Patriotic Party (NPP) founded by Taylor. Jewel Howard Taylor, Taylor’s former wife and now vice president to President George Weah, won two successive terms as senator for the county in 2005 and 2014.NPP and the Congress for Democratic Change (CDC) entered into a political marriage to contest the 2017 presidential and legislative elections. The merger prompted the formation of the ruling Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC) and the George Weah and Howard-Taylor ticket became victorious.The 2017 presidential results in Bong County show that the CDC amassed 61,520 votes, or 40 percent of the total votes cast in the county.

Liberia: Election Violence Between Two Rival Groups Results to Shooting in River Cess,Contributing Writer,"The night of Friday, January 27, 2023, was a scene of shooting and rioting between people believed to be loyal to River Cess County senatorial aspirants Bill Twehway and Andrew Peters in Boegeezay Town, District # 1, River Cess County.By: Trokon A. Freeman/+231777973957/+231886973957/[emailprotected]The supposedly two rival groups engaged in stone-throwing when Mr. Bill Twehway had gone to hold a town hall meeting with residents of Boegeezaay ahead of the October 10, 2023 polls.The incident was fueled by the pulling down of a billboard bearing the photo of Mr. Peters allegedly by Mr. Twehway’s supporters. The billboard was posted right opposite Yenkeen Business Center, a place that was paying host to Twehway and his team of supporters. The spot also has at the front view a very big billboard similarly carrying the photo of Aspirant Twehway. Andrew’s supporters said they could not sit seeing their leader’s banner brought down while their contender’s billboard was still up, and so they opted to retaliate, resulting into stone throwing and firing of live bullets. Reason for tearing down Andrew’s billboard is yet to be established.Related Posts Full Text: Alexander Cummings’ 2023 Independence Day…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: LFA Appoints Ethiopian Selam Zeray on a Two-year…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: Armed Forces Operation Against Pirates Attack on a…  Jul 26, 2023 Stones were directed at the guest house hosting Bill Twehway and those traveling along with him.

He said it was unfortunate while accusing Peters of masterminding the attack.“It’s unfortunate that we are not campaigning yet and the people engaged in election violence, where people were firing guns, and a handmade grenade at our car and us. that we had to run away to the police station. it is unfortunate”.“It’s no different political party, they are people from Andrew Peters’ camp.

Liberia: US$165K Clinic Funded By Community Logging Benefits Stalls Over Furniture,Contributing Writer,"Tiah Town Clinic was funded by benefits affected communities received from a logging concession between the Liberian government and International Capital Consultant (ICC). Construction works have been completed but lack of furniture supplies means the clinic cannot serve its people. The DayLight/Eric Opa DoueTIAH TOWN, Nimba County – Fifty-two-year-old Elizabeth Zialue traveled 55 kilometers from Tiah Town in Nimba to Boegeezay Town in River Cess County to seek treatment for her two-year-old grandson. Medical services in the Boegeezay community are free but Zialue has to pay LD3,500 for a motorcycle taxi to get there, and the same amount to get back.By Eric Opa Doue, special forThe DayLightZialue had lost her daughter, the boy’s mother, two years ago. “My daughter was sick when she delivered. There was no money to go to the hospital in Boegeezay or Tappita so she died,” she recalled.But Zialue’s daughter would not have died if a clinic Tiah Town was operational. In 2017, communities around here received US$125,000 to construct a clinic here in Tiah Town. The money was a portion of their benefits from a logging concession between the Liberian government and a logging company called International Capital Consultant (ICC). The concession, known in the forestry sector as Forest Management Contract Area K, covers 266,910 hectares of in both River Cess and Nimba. The community’s leadership added another US30,000 for other utilities such as water towers and an insinuator.The clinic’s construction started in April 2017 and was expected to be completed, dedicated for full operation in March 2018. The Nimba County Health Team was supposed to provide the workforce and medical and non-medical supplies for the running of the facility. Due to its strategic location, it was supposed to serve both River Cess and Nimba Counties when completed. Five years after its completion, nothing has happened according to plan. The National Benefit Sharing Trust Board, a watchdog that manages communities’ funds from forest concessions disbursed US$10,225.25 plus L$5.3 million to purchase furniture and drugs for the clinic. The fees come from logging-affected communities’ share of land rental fees companies pay to the Liberian government. However, the community’s forest leadership used the fund to build a guesthouse instead. Jerry Gbaye, the head of the leadership at the time, told The DayLight his decision to divert the fund was backed by all affected towns and villages in Gbi, Gbiagloh and Doru chiefdom, where the clinic is located. The clinic is meant to provide thousands of people access to healthcare in one of the remotest places in Liberia.“It was not the CFDC’s decision to use the money for a guesthouse,” Gbaye said. CFDC means community forest development committee, a body of villagers that co-manages a certain logging concession alongside the Forestry Development Authority (FDA).“The people of Gbiagloh and Gbi said the people of Doru already had the clinic in their area so that money should be used to construct a guesthouse for them to benefit, too,” he added.Related Posts Liberia: LFA Appoints Ethiopian Selam Zeray on a Two-year…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: Armed Forces Operation Against Pirates Attack on a…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: President Weah Issues Proclamation Calling the 54th…  Jul 25, 2023 Alfred Zelee, an elder responsible for Tiah Town’s development matters, refutes that claim. “If a decision was reached to use the money on the guesthouse, I don’t know,” said Zelee.” “All I know is that Gbaye took the money and used it on the guesthouse.“We are suffering here because few people decided to use the money from the land rental fees that they were supposed to use to put medicine in the clinic,” he added.The National Union of Community Forest Development Committee (NUCFDC), a group that advocates for the benefits for villagers affected by logging concessions, is investigating the matter.“We are now investigating whether the project was identified by the citizens and, and the project was awarded to a competent company,” said Andrew Zelemen, the national facilitator for the group in an interview with The DayLight. “Since it is established that the money was diverted, the NUCFDC is now contemplating what punishment awaits the [community’s leadership.”The Trust Board has also said it would not give the community’s leadership any more money unless it accounted for the furniture fund for the clinic, themost expensiveof the 53 projects it has funded countrywide since 2015.“The board has the intent to release additional funding for the Tiah Town project and all other uncompleted projects across the country, under conditions,” said Roberto Kollie, the head of the secretariat. “The first criterion is the [community’s leadership] must be able to present an assessment report to the board.“The Assessment report will include the project that was approved, the cost of the project, and the total amount that was disbursed for the implementation of the project and they must be able to provide a reason to the board why those projects were not completed.”Zialue in Tiah Town is unaware of the unfolding. Her grandchild was treated but she had to spend additional days in Boegeezay before going back to Tiah Town.“Ever since the people talked about the hospital about the hospital to build, everybody was happy, but today no head, no tail,” Zialue said. “We [are] still doing the same thing.”This story was originally published by The DayLight, and has been republished here by permission.

Manifesting Play-for-Play: Senator Johnson’s Outburst over Lack of Jobs for Nimba Sheds Light on Reasons Behind Sanctions,Selma Lomax,"MONROVIA —With ten months to the October presidential elections, it appears Senator Prince Y. Johnson has set into another pay-for-play scheme, and at the same time, threatening the incumbent President George Weah with the withdrawal of the county’s support in an attempt to have him succumb to his demands.The United States-sanctioned Nimba County Senator has said that he is ending his political marriage with President Weah because the president failed to provide jobs for Nimbaians (residents of the county) in exchange for support for Weah’s 2017 Presidential bid. Johnson’s announcement that he will not support Weah in the October 2023 election comes as some Nimba County residents are preparing to announce their support for President Weah later this month.“Let me clearly state that the agreement I signed with the president has come to an end, Johnson said.Johnson urges the president to cancel his trip until he can settle his obligations to the county. “The people of Nimba worked hard to elect President Weah, but he has ignored them”, the senator said.“The citizens of Nimba have for the past five years been knocking at my door for the President to appoint them,” Johnson said. “I have used all diplomatic means and have consistently engaged this CDC led government, but nothing is working.’’Last year, the United States sanctioned warlord-turned senator for alleged corruption under the Global Magnitsky Act. The act authorizes the United States government to sanction individuals it views as human rights offenders, freeze their assets, and ban them from entering the country.The U.S. government accuses Senator Johnson of being involved in pay-for-play funding scheme with government ministries and agencies for personal enrichment and offering the sale of votes in multiple Liberian elections in exchange for money.Under the scheme, the government ministries and agencies involved in the scheme launder a portion of the money. The scheme involves millions of dollars, according to a statement from the U.S. Embassy.The U.S. government said Johnson receives an undeserved salary from the Liberian government to provide intelligence crucial to maintaining domestic stability.“Johnson has also offered the sale of votes in multiple Liberian elections in exchange for money,” according to the U.S. government statement.Related Posts Full Text: Alexander Cummings’ 2023 Independence Day…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: LFA Appoints Ethiopian Selam Zeray on a Two-year…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: Armed Forces Operation Against Pirates Attack on a…  Jul 26, 2023 Johnson denounced the sanctions, telling the media that the allegations against him are “vague”, not fail to provide facts of his involvement in corruption.The senator said he is waiting for a more detailed explanation. He challenged the U.S. government to provide details about which specific administrations in Liberia had paid him corrupt fees.“What we want is the facts,” said Johnson. “You can accuse people, but the evidence is what is important. Coming from Uncle Sam’s website — obviously the most powerful nation on earth whose footprint we follow democratically — so you don’t just destroy people’s name by accusing them without facts.”In 2017, Weah promised to appoint Nimba citizens to top ministerial posts, managing directors and ambassador positions. The government is in its sixth year has failed to live up to his promise. In the last six years, only 2 persons from Nimba has held ministerial post.Senator Johnson called President Weah a “Promise breaker.’’ He said the Liberian leader only appointed his people from the southeast, ignoring the vote-rich Nimba County.A recognition stunt – NimbiansSenator Johnson’s move is, however, being condemned by many ordinary Nimbaians in the county, who say the ex-Liberian warlord’s moves are often for self-benefit and not the benefit of the entire county.“The only major development Sen. Johnson can boast of in this county is his university which he built in his own name,” Prince Dolo, a resident of Ganta City told FPA.Solomon Duakpah, a resident of Gompa, told FrontPage Africa, Senator Johnson is renowned for using his involvement in the civil war to threaten Nimbians to direct their directions during electioneering periods, cautioning his kinsmen to wise up ahead of the October presidential election.“It’s time we (Nimbians) shun Senator Johnson and make an independent decision, not to fall prey to his decisions in October. We have rewarded him as a county for his role played in defending our county during the civil war by voting him twice as a senator and supporting candidates he has asked us to support in previous elections but he hasn’t rewarded us as a county.”Saye Barlea, another native of Nimba County, said the Senator’s announcement calling for residents of the county to shun the pending petitioning program of the president is “late on arrival” as they (residents) are resolved to endorse President Weah. “We have understood Senator Johnson ‘s political gimmick and won’t cave into this any longer. We are prepared to endorse the president, and there is nothing that will stall this. Gone are the days Nimbians rely on Senator Johnson for political direction. Our overwhelming turnout will send a clear message to Senator Johnson ahead of the October presidential election.”Senator Johnson’s leverage in Nimba is rooted in his days as a warlord, who claims to have fought for the protection of the people of Nimba.He presided over the gruesome torture and killing of then President Samuel Doe. Doe’s ears were sliced off and he was left to bleed to death. A home video captures Johnson in fatigues, swigging Budweiser beer as he orders Doe’s torture.

"Liberia: Anger Still Fresh In Kokoyah, Bong County As Citizens Recount 2018 Police Raid",Selma Lomax,"Kokoyah District, Bong County-Liberia’s history is replete with disagreements between concessionaires and local communities. This has a background in the manner and form in which concession agreements are signed in Liberia, where the National Legislature ratifies agreement and those agreements are signed by the president granting certain rights to concessionaires to operate in a particular part of the country without the knowledge, consent and inputs of the people of the communities in which these concessionaires are to operate.By SelmaLomax, [emailprotected]In this way, the concessionaires care more about national government and believe they are only answerable to those in Monrovia and not the people of the communities in which these concessionaires operate.One classical example is the MNG Gold, a Turkish company operating in Kokoyah District, Bong County, which signed an agreement with the Government of Liberia to mine for gold in the gold-rich part of Bong County.This is the first in a three part Frontpage Africa special investigation series focusing on the sad story of how community members in a number of poor rural villages in Bong County impacted after a massive chemical spills from the MNG Gold Mining operations, the subsequent killing of four of their citizens, including a pregnant woman by the company’s vehicle driven by an expatriate contractual employee, who abandoned the dead bodies lying in the streets for hours without any kind of accountability or respect shown to the dead, ignited a protest which resulted into alleged arbitrary massive arrest, detention, torture, flogging and prosecution and imprisonments for alleged criminal violations, including looting.MNG Gold took over from American-Liberian Mining Company (AMLib) in 2013 and started active mining operations in 2015 operating on an old Mineral Development Agreement signed back in 2000.As per the MDA signed between AMLib and the government, the company contributes a meager US$12,000 per month or US$84,000 a year to Bong County Social Development Fund. It is not clear whether MNG Gold is still paying or has been paying this meager amount since 2015.No MOU with communitiesSince MNG Gold signed the concession agreement with the Government of Liberia, the company has been operating in Kokoyah District without any form of Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the local communities.This puts the company in the position to do anything it wishes, such as Corporate Social Responsibilities at their will as there is no written agreement detailing what is mandatory on the part of the company to be done for the people of the communities in which the company currently operates.MNG Gold has engaged in many forms of violations of environmental regulations with no concrete decisions from the Environmental Protection Agency of Liberia (EPA). The local communities are left to struggle the aftermath of these consistent environmental pollution and degradation.Communities within the MNG Gold area lack good health center, education as well as other facilities, and despite, complaints from citizens nothing has been done to address these issues.Polluting the environmentIn 2017, MNG Gold Mining Company discharged a massive amount of Cyanide in the main creek within the Kokoyah District leading to the pollution of drinking water, death of aquatic and terrestrial species and depriving the people sources of water for drinking, cultural, social, economic, spiritual, agricultural and traditional livelihoods and activities.Following the pollution, the Government of Liberia, through the National Bureau of Concession, commissioned an investigation which found MNG Gold liable for discharge of the harmful chemicals.The Bureau of Concession in a report submitted to the Liberian Senate indicated that MNG Gold discharged huge quantity of Cyanide, Mercury and other toxic chemical up to three million gallons of diverse toxic chemicals into the community and the report further indicated these chemicals will remain in the environment for decades to come.Adding to the NBC report, a Ghanaian laboratory service company (SGS) also investigated and concluded that the gravity of chemicals discharged by MNG Gold was so high.The Ghanaian firm indicated in its report that MNG Gold took no steps to protect people affected by the discharge of the chemicals.The spill was so cataphoric to the extent that in September 2017, 30 persons were admitted at the Phebe Hospital after the reservoir containing the chemicals belonging to MNG Gold overflowed with rainwater and later spilled into the nearby Sein Creek.The Sein Creek is a major source of water for residents of the Kokoyah area and the creek flows into other small waterways which made the pollution dangerous to a large number of people.As it is the case with these concession agreements where only the Central Government in Monrovia is the only one to whom these concessionaires are answerable, nothing concrete was done with the two negative reports about the chemical spills by MNG Gold.With the details of the chemical spills revealing that the chemicals will remain in the area for decades to come, the people were left to suffer within no plan in place to protect them from the health hazards posed by the chemicals.As a result and due to the inability of the Liberian Government to protect them from the aftermath of the dangerous pollution and their fears and concerns about the long-term implications of the impact on their health and environment, on October 8, 2018, a number of affected community members, filed a US$285 million Action of Damages for Wrong against MNG Gold at the Ninth Judicial Circuit Court in Bong County and the company filed an answer denying the claims.There are alleged reports of out of court settlement, but the amount, terms and conditions of the out-of-court settlements, including the beneficiaries remain unknown.Killing four peaceful citizensIn addition to the grabbing of their customary land and natural resources without their Free Prior Informed Consent and on top of the massive Cyanide spill, pollution and the risk of people living in these communities having no means to be protected from the harmful chemical spill, on November 5, 2018 a vehicle contracted by MNG Gold ran into peaceful citizens, killing four persons, including a pregnant woman instantly.Family members and community dwellers waited patiently for several hours to see the reaction of the company from the killing of their family members and relatives, but nothing was forthcoming as the company went about its normal operations while the dead bodies were lying on the road side abandoned.Related Posts Full Text: Alexander Cummings’ 2023 Independence Day…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: LFA Appoints Ethiopian Selam Zeray on a Two-year…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: Armed Forces Operation Against Pirates Attack on a…  Jul 26, 2023 A team of youth from the communities later went to the MNG Gold compound to inquire why the company was shown disrespect to their dead relatives especially, since among the dead abandoned on the road was the lifeless body of a pregnant woman exposed in the open, a strong cultural taboo in their communities.Additionally, the community requested for body bags to be used in disposal of their dead family members, but neither MNG Gold nor the Government of Liberia, could give them favorable response. As the result to no action, tension flared up and the youth demanded actions to respond to the grabbing of their customary lands, chemical spills and the death of their family members.As the protests, complaints, contest, grievances proceeded, the Liberian National Police responded with brute force, targeting the young people. During that interaction, the young people were accused by police of engaging in looting, vandalizing of MNG Gold facilities.Some elders and local leaders of the area disagreed and say it is the police that engaged in the looting only to blame the situation on the youth.‘Police lied on our children’In a recent interview with Front page Africa few years after the incident, the elders say they were denied the right to speak out because no one could air their views because MNG Gold is a big company with all the money.“They lied on our children and no one could tell our story because we do not have money like MNG Gold” said Anna Dean, Town Chief of David Dean’s Town.She said everyone could only hear what MNG Gold and the Government of Liberia through the Liberian National Police had to say and anything heard was thought to be truthful. According to a senior female Executive of Green Advocates International, “This is what is referred to as Corporate Capture, where a Multinational Corporation exercising unbridled powers captured and control the editorial decision-making authority of Media institutions and the criminal justice apparatus of the state and thus become a state with in a state. As a result, local community activists faced waves of criminalization from the Government and widespread stigmatization from the media.”The local leader accused the police of carrying out the looting and presenting the youth of the communities as bad people and arresting them randomly.Town Chief Dean added “Some of the children were coming from the bush, looking dirty but they were arrested by the police, how will someone looking dirty go in the company fence to go loot, they lied on our children”.Another community member, Roland K. Swaquee, who said he was arrested by the police at different locations, also said: “I was on my motorbike coming from Dolo’s Town to Dean’s Town, when the police saw me on the road, they arrested me and took my motorbike. I was in jail here in Dean’s Town for four days before my wife brought small money and we begged the police for me to be set free”.Swaquee said if he did not have any money, he would have been in jail like the other Defenders who are currently in prison. “The arrest by the police was not proper, Prince Bawon was arrested at the Step By Step Entertainment Center while sitting and drinking. When the police got there, the boys felt that they had done nothing wrong and were sitting and drinking but Prince and his friends were arrested but some of his friends’ parents had money this is why they were set free and Prince and others were taken to Jopolu Prison.Another victim, Peter F. Warkulah, said the arrest by the Liberian National Police was carried out through “hatred” as many young boys were arrested for no reason.“The arrest by the police here was done through hatred, the Police was just arresting people for no reason. People were arrested without investigation, as soon they grab you, they will just put you in the Police pickup, you not even have the opportunity to talk”, he said.At one instance, Peter said “They saw empty drum with one boy and he told them it was drum he can used to do his digging but the people said the drums is for the company, nothing to show that drum was for the company but they still arrested the boy and took him to jail”.How the Police turn the Victims into alleged perpetratorsDespite all that happened between the MNG Gold and the local communities ranging from the grabbing of their customary land and natural resources, the massive Cyanide spills and pollution to the death of four persons including a pregnant woman as a result of a vehicle hired by MNG Gold rushing into pedestrians, the Liberian National Police proceeded to carry on massive arrest of citizens accusing them of committing grave offenses and imposing frivolous criminal charges such armed robbery, arson, theft of property, criminal conspiracy, burglary, terroristic threat, criminal mischief and rioting.“Nobody heard us when the Government stole our land and give it to MNG, nobody heard us when MNG Gold polluted our water and many people were hospitalized. Nobody heard us when the company car killed four persons but the Government only acted when the Police looted and lied on our children”, said James Sayon, father of the late Samuel Sayon, one of the those killed by the MNG Gold hired vehicle that sparked the crisis.Said Sayon “Although I lost my son but I feel sorry for the innocent boys who are in jail. The Police just came and started arresting people who knew nothing about what happened. The Company could make this whole thing to not happen if they had shown concern for those that were killed.”He added, “Anybody could get angry, my son was killed and his scattered body was just lying on the street, the Government and the company do not care about human being, they only care about properties.”Sayon lamented “MNG Gold car already killed four persons from this town than they arrested our children for no reason, many of the children in jail are innocent, some people coming from the farm were arrested, people coming from doing their small mining were arrested and they are just keeping them in jail for nothing.”Human Rights Advocates seeking redressGreen Advocates International in partnership with the Yale Law School Allard K. Lowenstein International Human Rights Clinic, where Alfred L. Brownell, a Liberian, is a Professor of Law and Visiting Human Rights Fellow and a Goldman Prize Winner – are seeking answers to these massive abuses of human rights carried out against the citizens of Korkoyah, Bong County.A document obtained by FrontPageAfrica indicates that in November 28, 2022, Green Advocates International and the Yale Law School Allard K. Lowenstein International Human Rights Clinic submitted series of Allegation Letters to Eight (8) United Nations (“UN”) Special Rapporteurs Concerning Urgent Circumstances of 19 Liberian Environmental and Indigenous Defenders from the Bong County requesting these United Nations Special Rapporteurs to intervene and seek the release of the defenders.In the allegation letter to the UN working Group on Business and Human Rights, Green Advocates International and Yale Law School requested that the UN working Group recognize that both Liberia and MNG Gold have failed to comply with their obligations under the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.In the letter, the Green Advocates and the Yale Law School also urged Liberia and MNG Gold to take both prospective and retroactive actions to align their conduct with their obligations under the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights; and advocate for the protection of environmental defenders throughout Liberia.The letter also stated “finally, we ask all the UN Special Rapporteurs and the UN Working Group addressed in this letter to recognize the systemic problem in Liberia of corporate State capture, a situation in which the endemic corruption that plagues the State is abused by powerful corporations, especially in the sector of natural resources and mining; and urge the Liberian State to take steps to end this corruption and the encompassing corporate impunity for human rights violations”.Currently, there are 17 Environmental Indigenous Defenders still in prison at the Sanniquellie Central prison facing prison sentence and their entire story is that of people who have been victims of four major serious incidents, theft of their customary lands and natural resources referred to as land grabbing, a huge chemical spills with no redress.The death of four persons without justice and accountability and now they have face brute police force, horror, torture, deaths for some of their members and they are now forgotten to rot in dungeon only because they dare, dare to ask questions concerning their land, safety, livelihoods , the environment and their lives – a sad story of how the Liberian criminal justice systems turned poor rural indigenous victims into perpetrators.

"Liberia: 50% Pay Split: Rep. Gwion Downs 2022 with US$30,000; L$1.1M to District ",Contributing Writer,"GRAND GEDEH – For the year 2022, Representative Erol Madison Gwion, Sr. (LRP, Dist. #1, Grand Gedeh Co.) has given back to his Constituency a record amount of US$30,000 and LR$1,194,000 in fulfillment of his voluntary promise to equally share his monthly salary with his People for the purpose of rolling out basic development initiatives that will benefit them.Fully coming to terms with the vow to submit fifty percent of his salary presents a unique view in the politics of Liberia. Representative Gwion will do this until October 2023 by which time the full amount of US$69,593 will go back to the People through the Tchien District Development Council, Inc., the Chief of Office Staff, Justice Randall Clarke, tells FPA.The district development council, set up by Representative Gwion in April last year, says Clarke, manages the funding with accountability being the hallmark.Members of the Council are drawn from key institutions within the District, and the entity’s function, among other things, is to scrupulously identify the most relevant development priorities of the people in the district and make the needed intervention as well as promote accountability, peace and unity, and conflict prevention and mitigation. Rep. Gwion signed a notarized, legal Promissory Note, committing to the people of his District that he would give back to their half of his salary. He did that in October 2021 when he joined the race to become Representative of District #1 in the November 16, 2021 by-election in Grand Gedeh County.At the ballot, Gwion of the Liberia Restoration Party (LRP) decisively defeated rival Jeremiah G. Sokan of the governing Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC) who many “CDCians” in the district believe was wrongly picked to vie on the ticket of their party. Gwion himself is a founding member of the Congress for Democratic Change, the central contingent party of the ruling establishment, and ran for the same office in 2017 as its candidate but was pushed aside in the by-election in the absence of a primary vote.Related Posts Full Text: Alexander Cummings’ 2023 Independence Day…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: LFA Appoints Ethiopian Selam Zeray on a Two-year…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: Armed Forces Operation Against Pirates Attack on a…  Jul 26, 2023 What helped him win the election was that many Grand Gedeans, who serially stood by CDC and knew Gwion to be a central figure during the campaign in the County that brought massive support to George Weah, thought that he sacrificed a lot for the party’s success and did not need to be treated in an unfair manner.Meanwhile, since becoming Representative, Gwion has proven to be consistent with delivering on this promise to share his pay with the district for development.Presenting what many constituents called the first post-war Legislative Report to be made by a Representative of Tchien District, Gwion said he was not about the next election, but for the next generation.In January last year, he announced that as a Representative, he makes US$5,000 (representing 80 percent of his salary) and LR$199,000 (as 20 percent of his salary) thus apportioning to his District US$2,500 and LR$99,500 to account for a month. The essentially unprecedented move to cut his pay has boosted the popularity of Rep. Gwion amongst the people of Tchien District, FPA has learnt.So far, the 50% salary slice has resulted in some meaningful, impactful interventions made by the District Development Council. Some of the interventions are the procurement and installation of the 160KVA transformer now providing electricity to the Martha Tubman Memorial Hospital; donation of 50 bundles of zinc and 50 cartons of nails for the completion of a wing to the rehabilitated Zwedru Central Market; making available cash support to the all-female Gorhai Anu-wlua farmer group in the District; respectively supporting the construction of the Fula and Mandingo Islamic schools; enabling community radio Smile FM have a sustainable power source; and providing funding to four high schools in Zwedru to include Gbargba, Suah Memorial, Mike Tuleh, and Tubman Wilson Institute (TWI) for stationery.In early 2022, Representative Gwion also provided some 62 lights at the cost of US$6,350 for several major streets in Zwedru City, an initiative he said was not only meant to beautify the City, but also increase security in street corners and communities.

Liberia: The Farmer Defending His Land Against A Palm Plantation,Contributing Writer,"Saturday Wilson has defended his farmland against the Maryland Oil Palm Plantation (MOPP) for nearly 13 years. The DayLight/James Harding GiahyuePLEEBO, Maryland County – One day in 2016 policemen arrested Saturday Wilson at his farm. Wilson had been accused by the Maryland Oil Palm Plantation (MOPP) of stealing fertilizers, a court document shows.By James Harding Giahyue, with The DayLightWilson spent two days in a police cell and after a relatively short case, the Pleebo Magisterial Court sentenced him to three and a half months in prison. It said he prevented the company from clearing the land the government had leased to it.“I told [the judge], ‘For me, I am not embarrassing the concession but that is my land,’” Wilson tells The DayLight at his home in Gewloken in the Gbolobo Chiefdom of Pleebo Sodoken District.“I will serve my sentence but when I come, the land will remain there. I will meet it there. It will still be for me.”That was not Wilson’s first ordeal with MOPP, and not his last either. In the last 13 years, the 47-year-old farmer has been embroiled in a battle with the company over his farmland. It has placed him behind bars three times. However, he still owns the land.MOPP had come to Pleebo in 2010 and began clearing some 15,200 hectares of land ahead of itsagreementwith the Liberian government. Many people, including some of Wilson’s relatives,lost their villages, farmlands, ancestral graveyards and shrines. The following year, MOPP signed an agreement worth US$203 million for 25 years, stretching as far as Grand Kru.But Wilson would beat all odds to defend the remaining portion of his ancestral land. His family and the people of Gewloken had lost a huge swathe of land toDecoris Oil Palm Company, a previous Ivory Coast-based firm that operated in that region from 1980 to 1987. As a matter of fact, MOPP inherited the ruins of Decoris’ plantation as the result of Liberia’s first and second civil wars.This Drone photograph shows Gewleken, Saturday Wilson’s hometown, engulfed by Maryland Oil Palm Plantation. The DayLight/Derick SnyderWilson was a teenager back then but still remembers how Decoris wiped out his Gewloken town. Several generations of the Wilson clan had lived on the land as far back as the 1800s when Maryland was aterritory in Africa. In 1978, tribal chiefs and elders presented the family with a paper for the land, seen by The DayLight. In those days, customary land rights were not recognized but people were issued tribal certificates as a process leading to a formal title. Decoris, however, did not recognize that document. Now a full-grown man, Wilson could not afford to lose an inch of the land once more. “As a child when you coming up that land becomes part of you,” says the father of six. Wilson’s first encounter with MOPP happened in October 2010. MOPP had sent workers to clear land they claim is part of its concession area. They destroyed banana shrubs and rice stalks on his farm. Still haunted by memories of Decoris’ land grab, Wilson was furious. A scuffle ensued, with men from Gewloken joining the fray.Then the police arrived on the scene. “They went and arrested us, we were 16 persons, took us to Harper,” Wilson recalls. “So, after two days we were released.” After that encounter, Wilson and MOPP tried to resolve their issue but it would only lead to more tension. Bowing to pressure from some of his relatives, friends and local officials, Wilson agreed to give up his land with the agreement that MOPP would compensate him for his crops. In 2015, MOPP counted some of the crops on his farmland but abandoned the process after the first day, according to Wilson. His half-torn handwritten record of the count shows 2,259 plantain shrubs, 327 palm trees and 25 pineapple plants. Though frustrated over the failed crops compensation deal with MOPP, Wilson remained calm. In fact, he regretted having agreed to give out the land in the first place. Nearly all of the people who started the advocacy with him five years ago had given in. The ones in MOPP’s employ complained of alleged bad labor practices, including low wages.This photograph shot with a drone shows Gewloken, the hometown of Saturday Wilson, just next to the Maryland Oil Palm Plantation. The DayLight/Derick Snyder“I wanted to compromise with them… because of the tension,” Wilson says. “I am looking at other things to come. It’s better to maintain my piece of land than to work with the company. So, I am not willing to give it.”After Wilson returned from prison, he sought permission from the court to get back to his farm.Related Posts Full Text: Alexander Cummings’ 2023 Independence Day…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: LFA Appoints Ethiopian Selam Zeray on a Two-year…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: Armed Forces Operation Against Pirates Attack on a…  Jul 26, 2023 The court arranged a hearing between Wilson and the company’s legal team. Then came the big news: MOPP told the court they had no land case with him, according to Wilson. The DayLight could not verify that claim. Wesley Kortor, the magistrate of the Pleebo Magisterial Court said it could not locate the case file due to a burglary incident. Efforts to obtain the documents from MOPP and Wilson did not materialize.Wilson returned to his farm, happy that his struggles with MOPP were over, but his celebration would be short-lived once more. On Friday, June 8, 2018, MOPP workers made away with 180 bunches of palm nuts Wilson had harvested. He filed a complaint with MOPP’s community liaison committee, a body set up by the company to look into community grievances. It has been crucial in restoring calm to the region after MOPP’s controversial deal with the Liberian government.The Pleebo Magisterial Court, where Saturday Wilson was tried and convicted for stealing Maryland Oil Palm Plantation’s fertilizers. The DayLight/James Harding Giahyue“I am therefore using this medium to register these cases to your office and request your timely intervention and [a] peaceful resolution,” Wilson said in the complaint to Olando Karbeh, the chairperson of the committee. He was citing an incident just a month before where an MOPP staff took 40 of Wilson’s palm bunches, according to his handwritten letter featuring witnesses from the company, seen by The DayLight.Kouakou Bah, MOPP’s general manager at the time, accused Wilson of harvesting the palm nuts on MOPP’s side of their boundary. During the proceedings, Wilson argued that MOPP unilaterally demarcated boundaries. (Communities’ participation is a key concept in the global oil palm industry.) An investigation by the community liaison committee and county officials found Wilson was right, according to Karbeh. However, MOPP did not return Wilson’s harvests nor gave him any compensation. After that controversy, Wilson planted plantain trees on the widely accepted boundary between his 25-acre farm and the plantation to avert any future harvest rows.While that move has protected his estimated 2,000 palm trees, his relationship with MOPP has remained frosty within the last six years. In a meeting late last year with county officials and citizens, MOPP representative complained about Wilson’s farmland, people, who attended the meeting, say. “In the meeting, they said they were having problem with Saturday Wilson,” says Thomas Wilson, his brother and paramount chief for the Klebo Chiefdom under which Gewloken falls.“The City Mayor in Pleebo Wellington Kyne came out and said ‘Saturday is not with us in here… maybe he has something to say.’“I said in the meeting that the land that Saturday has is not even for him. It is for the.. Gewloken community,” Thomas Wilson adds in an interview at his home. Kyne corroborates his account in a phone interview.The Community Liaison Committee has asked MOPP to resolve its conflict with Wilson more than once but the company declined, says Karbeh, calling for an end to more than a decade of hostilities.It does not stop there. MOPP has refused to recognize him as a local palm farmer, also called a smallholder or an out-grower in the industry worldwide. The Maryland Oil Palm Outgrower Association has disclosed MOPP would begin purchasing local farmers’ harvests soon but Wilson is excluded, despite being a member of the group. He sells his harvests to Sopalm, a company more than 40 kilometers away in the Ivory coast, based on a receipt seen by The DayLight. He fears it would not change even if local farmers begin selling to MOPP.Kwia Nelson, the president of the association, says MOPP is retaliating against Wilson. “It seems to be that human being heart will never leave things, so MOPP looks at it that the area is still for the company so at the end of the day they don’t want to do business with him,” Nelson tells The DayLight in an interview at his home in Pleeboy City.“That is the information I have gathered as head [of the association].”Saturday Wilson stands at the boundary between his farmland and the Maryland Oil Palm Plantation (MOPP). It covers 25 acres and has about 2,000 palm trees, according to Wilson. The DayLight/James Harding GiahyueOutgrowers are crucial to MOPP’s concession with Liberia and the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), which sets the standards for the global industry. The concession agreement requires MOPP to buy outgrowers’ palm bunches at a set price and quality, among other things. The RSPO mandates its members to include smallholders in their development plans. Is one of seven principles the watchdog operates on. MOPP is Owned by theSIFCA Group, an Ivory Coast-based firm owned by the Singaporean multinationalWilmar International, a member of the RSPO.James Otto, a lead campaigner at the Sustainable Development Institute (SDI) that advocates for the rights of communities adjacent to the plantation, praises Wilson for defending his rights. Otto says Wilson’s ordeals discourage smallholder farming but show that people can stand up against powerful investors.“Saturday needs to be a hero,” Otto tells The DayLight in Monrovia of Wilson, who is captured in anew reportby SDI. “I call him the hero of the southeast.” MOPP did not respond to a set of questions The DayLight emailed to them nearly two weeks ago.Funding for this story was provided by the Green Livelihood Alliance (GLA 2.0) through the Community Rights and Corporate Governance Program of the Sustainable Development Institute (SDI).

Genoway, Jr(231886458910)[emailprotected]Gangama Town is a 15-minutes drive away from Liberia’s capital, Monrovia. Since the establishment of the Town, there has been no school building. The only school in the town, Gangama Public school, is being operated and run in a palava hut in the middle of the town.The elders, youths, students, and women of the town danced and sang over the weekend as they turned over a parcel of land to one of the sons of the town, Boakai Manoba to construct the first school for students in the town.Boakai Monoba lives in the United States and his mother hailed from the town. Boakai who runs his family’s foundation, the Family Movement Foundation, was disappointed when he visited his mother’s village and saw the children’s learning environment was not conducive.He immediately contacted his foundation technical team to gather the details sounding the school.Mr. Manobah first started with the tuition payment of all of the students in the school and engaged the town elders to make land available to erect the first school building in the town.At a well-attended appreciation and welcoming program held in the town for Mr. Manobah, elders gowned him (Manobah) for his great efforts and the transformation he’s bringing in the educational sector of the town.Related Posts Carver Christian University 2023 Graduates Urged to Use…  Jul 24, 2023 Liberia: Minister Sonii Extols Bea Mountain for Constructing…  Jul 22, 2023 Liberia: LEC, EJS Presidential Center Chat Ways on…  Jul 14, 2023 J.

Liberia: As Schools Outsourcing Experiment Falters Teachers Say It’s Time to Give Counties Control?,Eric Opa Duoe,"In part two of this two-part series with New Narratives Eric Opa Doue finds widespread opposition from teachers and civil society to government’s privatization of schools and a plea to government to abandon the scheme and let counties take charge.YARPAH TOWN, River Cess County – Emmanuel Yarbah squeezes onto a desk next to a classmate here in Togar Macintosh school. With a bare dirt floor and no ceiling, it is swelteringly hot. There are about 17 children in the classroom but only ten old desks. Not that it really matters. Even if it were a good setting for learning, there are no teachers.Report by Eric Opa Doue with New NarrativesFive of eleven teachers assigned to this school, which has been run by US-based for-profit Bridge International since 2016, school laid down their chalk in 2021 demanding salaries they say government owes them. The school is now being run by the vice principal for administration and four teachers. Many of the problems such as poor teacher training and no teaching materials have been laid at the feet of Bridge but the government is not meeting its obligations either.“The government is disappointing us,” says Sam Farley, head of the Parent Teachers Association here. “How will a principal be teaching in the school, that man will come here from 7:30am to 4 he will be on the school campus, then you go put ‘hold’ to the man check? Now our children now suffering. Not only the principal, but the other people also are not taking pay. All the teachers that came here, all of them gone and it affect us a lot.”The problems were the same in all Bridge schools visited by FPA/New Narratives in River Cess, Grand Bassa, Lofa and rural Montserrado. Critics of the Sirleaf government’s radical 2016 plan to outsource the education sector say they are not surprised by the outcome. The Center for Transparency and Accountability in Liberia (CENTAL), the accountability civil society organization then headed by Thomas Nah, (now head of the Liberian Revenue Authority) was a vocal opponent. Anderson Miamen, the current Cental head, says there is no quick fix to Liberia’s education problems. It needs serious investment and higher teacher salaries than the $150 a month on average they are currently paid.Miamen says government should have increased education spending to at least 20 percent of the country’s budget. (In 2022 the entire education system – primary through tertiary – received $92.3m or 11.7 per cent of the total budget.) Miamen says the government should decentralize the sector by creating and supporting county school boards.“We need to fix the public school system in a holistic way. Everybody needs to have an equal chance of accessing quality education,” says Miamen. “And the way to do it is not to introduce a program that will be discriminatory in terms of how it is rolled out. We don’t need a partner that will shield information from the communities, from the school authorities and even from the students, so that they cannot demand what is theirs.”Miamen says teacher training institutes in places like Maryland, Kakata and Lofa are training too few teachers. “So, you still have major, major gaps when it comes to trained and qualified. But then when you train the teachers you also have to motivate them. They have to be handsomely rewarded for their services. You have to create the enabling environment for them to move to the counties.”CENTAL’s Executive Director, Anderson Miamen: Photo by Eric Opa Doue.Attracting and retaining good teachers has been a major challenge in all of the rural schools visited by FPA/New Narratives in this investigation – whether they were part of LEAP or not. In many cases teachers had left simply because the government had never managed to get them onto the payroll system.Togar Macintosh was one of the first 23 schools given to Bridge in 2016 with promises of a big turnaround. Six years on that turnaround has never arrived. Buildings are crumbling, there aren’t enough teachers and Bridge is yet to supply teaching materials.The Memorandum of Understanding between the Government and Bridge stipulated that Bridge was to provide training for teachers and as well learning materials, while government was responsible for maintenance of the schools. Neither side was living up to their side of the deal at the Bridge controlled schools visited by NN/FPA during this investigation.“They can just come on the campus at time and promise,” says Moses Gbah, Vice Principal for Administration at Togar MacIntosh. “But we don’t know what is unfolding that they have not started with the maintenance of the school building.”Moses Gbah is the Vice Principal for Administration at Togar Macintosh (Bridge) School in River Cess: Photo by Eric Opa DoueRelated Posts Full Text: Alexander Cummings’ 2023 Independence Day…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: LFA Appoints Ethiopian Selam Zeray on a Two-year…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: Armed Forces Operation Against Pirates Attack on a…  Jul 26, 2023 One of the leaking classrooms at Sarah Sampson George (Bridge) School in Buchanan, Grand Bassa County: Photo by Eric Opa DoueNeither the Ministry of Education nor Bridge agreed to interviews for this article. After a series of broken appointment dates, Maxim Bleetem, head of communication at the Ministry of Education, referred this reporter to Gbovadeh Gbilia, Bridge’s Executive Director. In a WhatsApp chat Gbilia wrote that Bridge schools are the best in the country.“Well, you are telling me about teachers and CSOs and putting story in FrontPage,” Gbilia wrote. “Of course schools are dissatisfied with one thing or another. It’s one sided if you aren’t balancing it with schools that are praising us for our interventions. Especially the many, many Bridge schools who have 100% pass rate from the recently released 3rd and 6th grades WEAC results.” Gbilia referred this reporter to Barkedu Public School in Lofa as an example of Bridge success.However, FPA/New Narratives found the same problems at Barkedu. According to Principal Allieu V. Dulleh Barkedu has teacher shortages and limited teaching materials. Of 12 teachers in the school, the principal says only three are on the government’s payroll. The rest are volunteers.“Before Bridge took over, there were five government teachers,” said Dulleh by mobile phone. “So, out of the five, one person was retired by the government, and one other person was deleted from the payroll and up till now he has not been put back.”Dulleh said textbooks supplied by Bridge are not in line with the Liberian curriculum so teachers have to find their own materials to prepare students. Dulleh rejected Gbilia’s claim about students’ West Africa Examination Council results. No third graders from his school sat the WAEC exams because parents could not afford the fees. Despite the limited materials, Dulleh says, 14 out of 15 sixth graders who sat the test passed successfully. He says that was because of the extra efforts by teachers, not because of Bridge.“The way we do it required a thorough research by the staff and the school administration,” said Dulleh. “Because we need to make sure that those necessary materials, we get to other schools to get some of the materials to go the children.”4th Grade class at Togar Macintosh in Centra River Cess District: Photo by Eric Opa DoueSome government-run public schools performed well in the WEAC with no external support. For instance, 50 students from Bassa Demonstration School in Buchanan – in the same compound with Bridge school Sarah Sampson George – and 26 students from Gbediah Public School in Central River Cess all passed successfully.Principal Peter Gargar, of Gbediah Public School, is president of the River Cess branch of the National Teachers’ Association Liberia (NTAL). He also says there is no need for LEAP. “The non-LEAP schools’ students are performing well as compared to their LEAP counterparts,” says Gargar. “That is because what they are teaching the children is different. They are not going by the curriculum.”Teachers have been opposed to LEAP from the start. In April 2020 the NTAL and eleven civil society organizations, joined with teacher organizations from Kenya, Nigeria, South African and Uganda to petition government to abandon LEAP.“Lack of independent evidence, transparency, and accountability,” on the part of government and the providers were among issues raised in the petition. But Samuel Johnson, Secretary General of the NTAL, says till now the government is yet to respond.Johnson agrees with Cental’s Miamen that the system should be put in the hands of counties.“Every county get their own school system and they pay teachers according to qualification,” says Johnson. “They do continual professional development to train people who are already in their area. When you improve all of these things, as it is done in our neighboring countries, the sector will improve.”For now, students like Yarbah are paying a price for failures in Liberia’s education system. And another generation of students risks being left behind.This two-part series was a collaboration with New Narratives as part of the Investigating Liberia project.

Liberia: Jailed President Charles Taylor’s Birthday Passes Unnoticed In Gbarnga,Selma Lomax,"BONG COUNTY – Former Liberian president Charles Taylor on Saturday, January 28 celebrated his 75th birthday, but his natal day appeared to have gone unnoticed in Bong County, where he served as rebel leader in the 1990s.Taylor’s admirers have always celebrated his birthday in Bong County since he was sentenced to a 50-year jail sentence in the United Kingdom for aiding and abetting rebels in neighboring Sierra Leone during the 1991-2002 civil war.By Selma Lomax, [emailprotected]However, many of these admirers this year refused to throw up a party as they did in the past, blaming it on the current economic hardship.Jerry Forkpah, lex-fighter of Taylor’s former army the Anti Terrorist Unit, who has always made January 28 his personal holiday, said though the former Liberian president still holds a place in his heart, he was more concerned about his livelihood than celebrating a man he says won’t return to Liberia anytime soon.“I celebrated Taylor’s birthday in the past because I had faith he would one day return, but it has been more than 15 years since he was jailed and there are no signs he will return,” he said.“Feeding in Liberia today is not easy as food, which is a basic need, has become a difficult for the ordinary people like us. Prices of foodstuffs are now triple the prices they were before and they increase daily without control,” says Martin Kamara, 43, who spent all his youthful days in Gbarnga during Taylor revolution. “Our prayers are with.”Related Posts Full Text: Alexander Cummings’ 2023 Independence Day…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: LFA Appoints Ethiopian Selam Zeray on a Two-year…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: Armed Forces Operation Against Pirates Attack on a…  Jul 26, 2023 “You go to the market with a substantial amount of money, but you end up asking yourself what you bought because your shopping bag appears to be empty. This is after walking round the market to see where you can get fair prices,” Martha Gorlotor, a resident of Gbarnga, said.The Kpelle people, who dominate Bong County and are the largest tribe in the country, suffered the most human rights violations of all of Liberia’s 16 tribes recorded in the TRC report. Almost 19,000 of them were killed, enslaved, raped and tortured—among other crimes.Over 22,000 human rights violations were committed in Bong County as a whole, the second highest number of violations, behind Montserrado County. The TRC recommended more than a decade ago that Taylor face a war crimes court for Liberia over the crimes his group committed in the country.Taylor’s forces committed 41 per cent of the crimes committed during the war and recorded by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), the highest number of any faction.Taylor had formed the National Patriotic Reconstruction Assembly Government (NPRAG) in Bong’s capital Gbargna, after his Christmas Day invasion into Nimba from Ivory Coast in 1989.Taylor envisaged a future Liberian capital be moved in Bong County from Monrovia, a call that resonated with people in the county. It was from there that Taylor launched attacks on rival warring factions in the southeastern, northern and western parts of the country.Bong County is the stronghold of the National Patriotic Party (NPP) founded by Taylor. Jewel Howard Taylor, Taylor’s former wife and now vice president to President George Weah, won two successive terms as senator for the county in 2005 and 2014.NPP and the Congress for Democratic Change (CDC) entered into a political marriage to contest the 2017 presidential and legislative elections. The merger prompted the formation of the ruling Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC) and the George Weah and Howard-Taylor ticket became victorious.The 2017 presidential results in Bong County show that the CDC amassed 61,520 votes, or 40 percent of the total votes cast in the county.

Liberia: Election Violence Between Two Rival Groups Results to Shooting in River Cess,Contributing Writer,"The night of Friday, January 27, 2023, was a scene of shooting and rioting between people believed to be loyal to River Cess County senatorial aspirants Bill Twehway and Andrew Peters in Boegeezay Town, District # 1, River Cess County.By: Trokon A. Freeman/+231777973957/+231886973957/[emailprotected]The supposedly two rival groups engaged in stone-throwing when Mr. Bill Twehway had gone to hold a town hall meeting with residents of Boegeezaay ahead of the October 10, 2023 polls.The incident was fueled by the pulling down of a billboard bearing the photo of Mr. Peters allegedly by Mr. Twehway’s supporters. The billboard was posted right opposite Yenkeen Business Center, a place that was paying host to Twehway and his team of supporters. The spot also has at the front view a very big billboard similarly carrying the photo of Aspirant Twehway. Andrew’s supporters said they could not sit seeing their leader’s banner brought down while their contender’s billboard was still up, and so they opted to retaliate, resulting into stone throwing and firing of live bullets. Reason for tearing down Andrew’s billboard is yet to be established.Related Posts Full Text: Alexander Cummings’ 2023 Independence Day…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: LFA Appoints Ethiopian Selam Zeray on a Two-year…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: Armed Forces Operation Against Pirates Attack on a…  Jul 26, 2023 Stones were directed at the guest house hosting Bill Twehway and those traveling along with him.

He said it was unfortunate while accusing Peters of masterminding the attack.“It’s unfortunate that we are not campaigning yet and the people engaged in election violence, where people were firing guns, and a handmade grenade at our car and us. that we had to run away to the police station. it is unfortunate”.“It’s no different political party, they are people from Andrew Peters’ camp.

Liberia: US$165K Clinic Funded By Community Logging Benefits Stalls Over Furniture,Contributing Writer,"Tiah Town Clinic was funded by benefits affected communities received from a logging concession between the Liberian government and International Capital Consultant (ICC). Construction works have been completed but lack of furniture supplies means the clinic cannot serve its people. The DayLight/Eric Opa DoueTIAH TOWN, Nimba County – Fifty-two-year-old Elizabeth Zialue traveled 55 kilometers from Tiah Town in Nimba to Boegeezay Town in River Cess County to seek treatment for her two-year-old grandson. Medical services in the Boegeezay community are free but Zialue has to pay LD3,500 for a motorcycle taxi to get there, and the same amount to get back.By Eric Opa Doue, special forThe DayLightZialue had lost her daughter, the boy’s mother, two years ago. “My daughter was sick when she delivered. There was no money to go to the hospital in Boegeezay or Tappita so she died,” she recalled.But Zialue’s daughter would not have died if a clinic Tiah Town was operational. In 2017, communities around here received US$125,000 to construct a clinic here in Tiah Town. The money was a portion of their benefits from a logging concession between the Liberian government and a logging company called International Capital Consultant (ICC). The concession, known in the forestry sector as Forest Management Contract Area K, covers 266,910 hectares of in both River Cess and Nimba. The community’s leadership added another US30,000 for other utilities such as water towers and an insinuator.The clinic’s construction started in April 2017 and was expected to be completed, dedicated for full operation in March 2018. The Nimba County Health Team was supposed to provide the workforce and medical and non-medical supplies for the running of the facility. Due to its strategic location, it was supposed to serve both River Cess and Nimba Counties when completed. Five years after its completion, nothing has happened according to plan. The National Benefit Sharing Trust Board, a watchdog that manages communities’ funds from forest concessions disbursed US$10,225.25 plus L$5.3 million to purchase furniture and drugs for the clinic. The fees come from logging-affected communities’ share of land rental fees companies pay to the Liberian government. However, the community’s forest leadership used the fund to build a guesthouse instead. Jerry Gbaye, the head of the leadership at the time, told The DayLight his decision to divert the fund was backed by all affected towns and villages in Gbi, Gbiagloh and Doru chiefdom, where the clinic is located. The clinic is meant to provide thousands of people access to healthcare in one of the remotest places in Liberia.“It was not the CFDC’s decision to use the money for a guesthouse,” Gbaye said. CFDC means community forest development committee, a body of villagers that co-manages a certain logging concession alongside the Forestry Development Authority (FDA).“The people of Gbiagloh and Gbi said the people of Doru already had the clinic in their area so that money should be used to construct a guesthouse for them to benefit, too,” he added.Related Posts Liberia: LFA Appoints Ethiopian Selam Zeray on a Two-year…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: Armed Forces Operation Against Pirates Attack on a…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: President Weah Issues Proclamation Calling the 54th…  Jul 25, 2023 Alfred Zelee, an elder responsible for Tiah Town’s development matters, refutes that claim. “If a decision was reached to use the money on the guesthouse, I don’t know,” said Zelee.” “All I know is that Gbaye took the money and used it on the guesthouse.“We are suffering here because few people decided to use the money from the land rental fees that they were supposed to use to put medicine in the clinic,” he added.The National Union of Community Forest Development Committee (NUCFDC), a group that advocates for the benefits for villagers affected by logging concessions, is investigating the matter.“We are now investigating whether the project was identified by the citizens and, and the project was awarded to a competent company,” said Andrew Zelemen, the national facilitator for the group in an interview with The DayLight. “Since it is established that the money was diverted, the NUCFDC is now contemplating what punishment awaits the [community’s leadership.”The Trust Board has also said it would not give the community’s leadership any more money unless it accounted for the furniture fund for the clinic, themost expensiveof the 53 projects it has funded countrywide since 2015.“The board has the intent to release additional funding for the Tiah Town project and all other uncompleted projects across the country, under conditions,” said Roberto Kollie, the head of the secretariat. “The first criterion is the [community’s leadership] must be able to present an assessment report to the board.“The Assessment report will include the project that was approved, the cost of the project, and the total amount that was disbursed for the implementation of the project and they must be able to provide a reason to the board why those projects were not completed.”Zialue in Tiah Town is unaware of the unfolding. Her grandchild was treated but she had to spend additional days in Boegeezay before going back to Tiah Town.“Ever since the people talked about the hospital about the hospital to build, everybody was happy, but today no head, no tail,” Zialue said. “We [are] still doing the same thing.”This story was originally published by The DayLight, and has been republished here by permission.

Manifesting Play-for-Play: Senator Johnson’s Outburst over Lack of Jobs for Nimba Sheds Light on Reasons Behind Sanctions,Selma Lomax,"MONROVIA —With ten months to the October presidential elections, it appears Senator Prince Y. Johnson has set into another pay-for-play scheme, and at the same time, threatening the incumbent President George Weah with the withdrawal of the county’s support in an attempt to have him succumb to his demands.The United States-sanctioned Nimba County Senator has said that he is ending his political marriage with President Weah because the president failed to provide jobs for Nimbaians (residents of the county) in exchange for support for Weah’s 2017 Presidential bid. Johnson’s announcement that he will not support Weah in the October 2023 election comes as some Nimba County residents are preparing to announce their support for President Weah later this month.“Let me clearly state that the agreement I signed with the president has come to an end, Johnson said.Johnson urges the president to cancel his trip until he can settle his obligations to the county. “The people of Nimba worked hard to elect President Weah, but he has ignored them”, the senator said.“The citizens of Nimba have for the past five years been knocking at my door for the President to appoint them,” Johnson said. “I have used all diplomatic means and have consistently engaged this CDC led government, but nothing is working.’’Last year, the United States sanctioned warlord-turned senator for alleged corruption under the Global Magnitsky Act. The act authorizes the United States government to sanction individuals it views as human rights offenders, freeze their assets, and ban them from entering the country.The U.S. government accuses Senator Johnson of being involved in pay-for-play funding scheme with government ministries and agencies for personal enrichment and offering the sale of votes in multiple Liberian elections in exchange for money.Under the scheme, the government ministries and agencies involved in the scheme launder a portion of the money. The scheme involves millions of dollars, according to a statement from the U.S. Embassy.The U.S. government said Johnson receives an undeserved salary from the Liberian government to provide intelligence crucial to maintaining domestic stability.“Johnson has also offered the sale of votes in multiple Liberian elections in exchange for money,” according to the U.S. government statement.Related Posts Full Text: Alexander Cummings’ 2023 Independence Day…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: LFA Appoints Ethiopian Selam Zeray on a Two-year…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: Armed Forces Operation Against Pirates Attack on a…  Jul 26, 2023 Johnson denounced the sanctions, telling the media that the allegations against him are “vague”, not fail to provide facts of his involvement in corruption.The senator said he is waiting for a more detailed explanation. He challenged the U.S. government to provide details about which specific administrations in Liberia had paid him corrupt fees.“What we want is the facts,” said Johnson. “You can accuse people, but the evidence is what is important. Coming from Uncle Sam’s website — obviously the most powerful nation on earth whose footprint we follow democratically — so you don’t just destroy people’s name by accusing them without facts.”In 2017, Weah promised to appoint Nimba citizens to top ministerial posts, managing directors and ambassador positions. The government is in its sixth year has failed to live up to his promise. In the last six years, only 2 persons from Nimba has held ministerial post.Senator Johnson called President Weah a “Promise breaker.’’ He said the Liberian leader only appointed his people from the southeast, ignoring the vote-rich Nimba County.A recognition stunt – NimbiansSenator Johnson’s move is, however, being condemned by many ordinary Nimbaians in the county, who say the ex-Liberian warlord’s moves are often for self-benefit and not the benefit of the entire county.“The only major development Sen. Johnson can boast of in this county is his university which he built in his own name,” Prince Dolo, a resident of Ganta City told FPA.Solomon Duakpah, a resident of Gompa, told FrontPage Africa, Senator Johnson is renowned for using his involvement in the civil war to threaten Nimbians to direct their directions during electioneering periods, cautioning his kinsmen to wise up ahead of the October presidential election.“It’s time we (Nimbians) shun Senator Johnson and make an independent decision, not to fall prey to his decisions in October. We have rewarded him as a county for his role played in defending our county during the civil war by voting him twice as a senator and supporting candidates he has asked us to support in previous elections but he hasn’t rewarded us as a county.”Saye Barlea, another native of Nimba County, said the Senator’s announcement calling for residents of the county to shun the pending petitioning program of the president is “late on arrival” as they (residents) are resolved to endorse President Weah. “We have understood Senator Johnson ‘s political gimmick and won’t cave into this any longer. We are prepared to endorse the president, and there is nothing that will stall this. Gone are the days Nimbians rely on Senator Johnson for political direction. Our overwhelming turnout will send a clear message to Senator Johnson ahead of the October presidential election.”Senator Johnson’s leverage in Nimba is rooted in his days as a warlord, who claims to have fought for the protection of the people of Nimba.He presided over the gruesome torture and killing of then President Samuel Doe. Doe’s ears were sliced off and he was left to bleed to death. A home video captures Johnson in fatigues, swigging Budweiser beer as he orders Doe’s torture.

"Liberia: Anger Still Fresh In Kokoyah, Bong County As Citizens Recount 2018 Police Raid",Selma Lomax,"Kokoyah District, Bong County-Liberia’s history is replete with disagreements between concessionaires and local communities. This has a background in the manner and form in which concession agreements are signed in Liberia, where the National Legislature ratifies agreement and those agreements are signed by the president granting certain rights to concessionaires to operate in a particular part of the country without the knowledge, consent and inputs of the people of the communities in which these concessionaires are to operate.By SelmaLomax, [emailprotected]In this way, the concessionaires care more about national government and believe they are only answerable to those in Monrovia and not the people of the communities in which these concessionaires operate.One classical example is the MNG Gold, a Turkish company operating in Kokoyah District, Bong County, which signed an agreement with the Government of Liberia to mine for gold in the gold-rich part of Bong County.This is the first in a three part Frontpage Africa special investigation series focusing on the sad story of how community members in a number of poor rural villages in Bong County impacted after a massive chemical spills from the MNG Gold Mining operations, the subsequent killing of four of their citizens, including a pregnant woman by the company’s vehicle driven by an expatriate contractual employee, who abandoned the dead bodies lying in the streets for hours without any kind of accountability or respect shown to the dead, ignited a protest which resulted into alleged arbitrary massive arrest, detention, torture, flogging and prosecution and imprisonments for alleged criminal violations, including looting.MNG Gold took over from American-Liberian Mining Company (AMLib) in 2013 and started active mining operations in 2015 operating on an old Mineral Development Agreement signed back in 2000.As per the MDA signed between AMLib and the government, the company contributes a meager US$12,000 per month or US$84,000 a year to Bong County Social Development Fund. It is not clear whether MNG Gold is still paying or has been paying this meager amount since 2015.No MOU with communitiesSince MNG Gold signed the concession agreement with the Government of Liberia, the company has been operating in Kokoyah District without any form of Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the local communities.This puts the company in the position to do anything it wishes, such as Corporate Social Responsibilities at their will as there is no written agreement detailing what is mandatory on the part of the company to be done for the people of the communities in which the company currently operates.MNG Gold has engaged in many forms of violations of environmental regulations with no concrete decisions from the Environmental Protection Agency of Liberia (EPA). The local communities are left to struggle the aftermath of these consistent environmental pollution and degradation.Communities within the MNG Gold area lack good health center, education as well as other facilities, and despite, complaints from citizens nothing has been done to address these issues.Polluting the environmentIn 2017, MNG Gold Mining Company discharged a massive amount of Cyanide in the main creek within the Kokoyah District leading to the pollution of drinking water, death of aquatic and terrestrial species and depriving the people sources of water for drinking, cultural, social, economic, spiritual, agricultural and traditional livelihoods and activities.Following the pollution, the Government of Liberia, through the National Bureau of Concession, commissioned an investigation which found MNG Gold liable for discharge of the harmful chemicals.The Bureau of Concession in a report submitted to the Liberian Senate indicated that MNG Gold discharged huge quantity of Cyanide, Mercury and other toxic chemical up to three million gallons of diverse toxic chemicals into the community and the report further indicated these chemicals will remain in the environment for decades to come.Adding to the NBC report, a Ghanaian laboratory service company (SGS) also investigated and concluded that the gravity of chemicals discharged by MNG Gold was so high.The Ghanaian firm indicated in its report that MNG Gold took no steps to protect people affected by the discharge of the chemicals.The spill was so cataphoric to the extent that in September 2017, 30 persons were admitted at the Phebe Hospital after the reservoir containing the chemicals belonging to MNG Gold overflowed with rainwater and later spilled into the nearby Sein Creek.The Sein Creek is a major source of water for residents of the Kokoyah area and the creek flows into other small waterways which made the pollution dangerous to a large number of people.As it is the case with these concession agreements where only the Central Government in Monrovia is the only one to whom these concessionaires are answerable, nothing concrete was done with the two negative reports about the chemical spills by MNG Gold.With the details of the chemical spills revealing that the chemicals will remain in the area for decades to come, the people were left to suffer within no plan in place to protect them from the health hazards posed by the chemicals.As a result and due to the inability of the Liberian Government to protect them from the aftermath of the dangerous pollution and their fears and concerns about the long-term implications of the impact on their health and environment, on October 8, 2018, a number of affected community members, filed a US$285 million Action of Damages for Wrong against MNG Gold at the Ninth Judicial Circuit Court in Bong County and the company filed an answer denying the claims.There are alleged reports of out of court settlement, but the amount, terms and conditions of the out-of-court settlements, including the beneficiaries remain unknown.Killing four peaceful citizensIn addition to the grabbing of their customary land and natural resources without their Free Prior Informed Consent and on top of the massive Cyanide spill, pollution and the risk of people living in these communities having no means to be protected from the harmful chemical spill, on November 5, 2018 a vehicle contracted by MNG Gold ran into peaceful citizens, killing four persons, including a pregnant woman instantly.Family members and community dwellers waited patiently for several hours to see the reaction of the company from the killing of their family members and relatives, but nothing was forthcoming as the company went about its normal operations while the dead bodies were lying on the road side abandoned.Related Posts Full Text: Alexander Cummings’ 2023 Independence Day…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: LFA Appoints Ethiopian Selam Zeray on a Two-year…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: Armed Forces Operation Against Pirates Attack on a…  Jul 26, 2023 A team of youth from the communities later went to the MNG Gold compound to inquire why the company was shown disrespect to their dead relatives especially, since among the dead abandoned on the road was the lifeless body of a pregnant woman exposed in the open, a strong cultural taboo in their communities.Additionally, the community requested for body bags to be used in disposal of their dead family members, but neither MNG Gold nor the Government of Liberia, could give them favorable response. As the result to no action, tension flared up and the youth demanded actions to respond to the grabbing of their customary lands, chemical spills and the death of their family members.As the protests, complaints, contest, grievances proceeded, the Liberian National Police responded with brute force, targeting the young people. During that interaction, the young people were accused by police of engaging in looting, vandalizing of MNG Gold facilities.Some elders and local leaders of the area disagreed and say it is the police that engaged in the looting only to blame the situation on the youth.‘Police lied on our children’In a recent interview with Front page Africa few years after the incident, the elders say they were denied the right to speak out because no one could air their views because MNG Gold is a big company with all the money.“They lied on our children and no one could tell our story because we do not have money like MNG Gold” said Anna Dean, Town Chief of David Dean’s Town.She said everyone could only hear what MNG Gold and the Government of Liberia through the Liberian National Police had to say and anything heard was thought to be truthful. According to a senior female Executive of Green Advocates International, “This is what is referred to as Corporate Capture, where a Multinational Corporation exercising unbridled powers captured and control the editorial decision-making authority of Media institutions and the criminal justice apparatus of the state and thus become a state with in a state. As a result, local community activists faced waves of criminalization from the Government and widespread stigmatization from the media.”The local leader accused the police of carrying out the looting and presenting the youth of the communities as bad people and arresting them randomly.Town Chief Dean added “Some of the children were coming from the bush, looking dirty but they were arrested by the police, how will someone looking dirty go in the company fence to go loot, they lied on our children”.Another community member, Roland K. Swaquee, who said he was arrested by the police at different locations, also said: “I was on my motorbike coming from Dolo’s Town to Dean’s Town, when the police saw me on the road, they arrested me and took my motorbike. I was in jail here in Dean’s Town for four days before my wife brought small money and we begged the police for me to be set free”.Swaquee said if he did not have any money, he would have been in jail like the other Defenders who are currently in prison. “The arrest by the police was not proper, Prince Bawon was arrested at the Step By Step Entertainment Center while sitting and drinking. When the police got there, the boys felt that they had done nothing wrong and were sitting and drinking but Prince and his friends were arrested but some of his friends’ parents had money this is why they were set free and Prince and others were taken to Jopolu Prison.Another victim, Peter F. Warkulah, said the arrest by the Liberian National Police was carried out through “hatred” as many young boys were arrested for no reason.“The arrest by the police here was done through hatred, the Police was just arresting people for no reason. People were arrested without investigation, as soon they grab you, they will just put you in the Police pickup, you not even have the opportunity to talk”, he said.At one instance, Peter said “They saw empty drum with one boy and he told them it was drum he can used to do his digging but the people said the drums is for the company, nothing to show that drum was for the company but they still arrested the boy and took him to jail”.How the Police turn the Victims into alleged perpetratorsDespite all that happened between the MNG Gold and the local communities ranging from the grabbing of their customary land and natural resources, the massive Cyanide spills and pollution to the death of four persons including a pregnant woman as a result of a vehicle hired by MNG Gold rushing into pedestrians, the Liberian National Police proceeded to carry on massive arrest of citizens accusing them of committing grave offenses and imposing frivolous criminal charges such armed robbery, arson, theft of property, criminal conspiracy, burglary, terroristic threat, criminal mischief and rioting.“Nobody heard us when the Government stole our land and give it to MNG, nobody heard us when MNG Gold polluted our water and many people were hospitalized. Nobody heard us when the company car killed four persons but the Government only acted when the Police looted and lied on our children”, said James Sayon, father of the late Samuel Sayon, one of the those killed by the MNG Gold hired vehicle that sparked the crisis.Said Sayon “Although I lost my son but I feel sorry for the innocent boys who are in jail. The Police just came and started arresting people who knew nothing about what happened. The Company could make this whole thing to not happen if they had shown concern for those that were killed.”He added, “Anybody could get angry, my son was killed and his scattered body was just lying on the street, the Government and the company do not care about human being, they only care about properties.”Sayon lamented “MNG Gold car already killed four persons from this town than they arrested our children for no reason, many of the children in jail are innocent, some people coming from the farm were arrested, people coming from doing their small mining were arrested and they are just keeping them in jail for nothing.”Human Rights Advocates seeking redressGreen Advocates International in partnership with the Yale Law School Allard K. Lowenstein International Human Rights Clinic, where Alfred L. Brownell, a Liberian, is a Professor of Law and Visiting Human Rights Fellow and a Goldman Prize Winner – are seeking answers to these massive abuses of human rights carried out against the citizens of Korkoyah, Bong County.A document obtained by FrontPageAfrica indicates that in November 28, 2022, Green Advocates International and the Yale Law School Allard K. Lowenstein International Human Rights Clinic submitted series of Allegation Letters to Eight (8) United Nations (“UN”) Special Rapporteurs Concerning Urgent Circumstances of 19 Liberian Environmental and Indigenous Defenders from the Bong County requesting these United Nations Special Rapporteurs to intervene and seek the release of the defenders.In the allegation letter to the UN working Group on Business and Human Rights, Green Advocates International and Yale Law School requested that the UN working Group recognize that both Liberia and MNG Gold have failed to comply with their obligations under the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.In the letter, the Green Advocates and the Yale Law School also urged Liberia and MNG Gold to take both prospective and retroactive actions to align their conduct with their obligations under the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights; and advocate for the protection of environmental defenders throughout Liberia.The letter also stated “finally, we ask all the UN Special Rapporteurs and the UN Working Group addressed in this letter to recognize the systemic problem in Liberia of corporate State capture, a situation in which the endemic corruption that plagues the State is abused by powerful corporations, especially in the sector of natural resources and mining; and urge the Liberian State to take steps to end this corruption and the encompassing corporate impunity for human rights violations”.Currently, there are 17 Environmental Indigenous Defenders still in prison at the Sanniquellie Central prison facing prison sentence and their entire story is that of people who have been victims of four major serious incidents, theft of their customary lands and natural resources referred to as land grabbing, a huge chemical spills with no redress.The death of four persons without justice and accountability and now they have face brute police force, horror, torture, deaths for some of their members and they are now forgotten to rot in dungeon only because they dare, dare to ask questions concerning their land, safety, livelihoods , the environment and their lives – a sad story of how the Liberian criminal justice systems turned poor rural indigenous victims into perpetrators.

"Liberia: 50% Pay Split: Rep. Gwion Downs 2022 with US$30,000; L$1.1M to District ",Contributing Writer,"GRAND GEDEH – For the year 2022, Representative Erol Madison Gwion, Sr. (LRP, Dist. #1, Grand Gedeh Co.) has given back to his Constituency a record amount of US$30,000 and LR$1,194,000 in fulfillment of his voluntary promise to equally share his monthly salary with his People for the purpose of rolling out basic development initiatives that will benefit them.Fully coming to terms with the vow to submit fifty percent of his salary presents a unique view in the politics of Liberia. Representative Gwion will do this until October 2023 by which time the full amount of US$69,593 will go back to the People through the Tchien District Development Council, Inc., the Chief of Office Staff, Justice Randall Clarke, tells FPA.The district development council, set up by Representative Gwion in April last year, says Clarke, manages the funding with accountability being the hallmark.Members of the Council are drawn from key institutions within the District, and the entity’s function, among other things, is to scrupulously identify the most relevant development priorities of the people in the district and make the needed intervention as well as promote accountability, peace and unity, and conflict prevention and mitigation. Rep. Gwion signed a notarized, legal Promissory Note, committing to the people of his District that he would give back to their half of his salary. He did that in October 2021 when he joined the race to become Representative of District #1 in the November 16, 2021 by-election in Grand Gedeh County.At the ballot, Gwion of the Liberia Restoration Party (LRP) decisively defeated rival Jeremiah G. Sokan of the governing Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC) who many “CDCians” in the district believe was wrongly picked to vie on the ticket of their party. Gwion himself is a founding member of the Congress for Democratic Change, the central contingent party of the ruling establishment, and ran for the same office in 2017 as its candidate but was pushed aside in the by-election in the absence of a primary vote.Related Posts Full Text: Alexander Cummings’ 2023 Independence Day…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: LFA Appoints Ethiopian Selam Zeray on a Two-year…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: Armed Forces Operation Against Pirates Attack on a…  Jul 26, 2023 What helped him win the election was that many Grand Gedeans, who serially stood by CDC and knew Gwion to be a central figure during the campaign in the County that brought massive support to George Weah, thought that he sacrificed a lot for the party’s success and did not need to be treated in an unfair manner.Meanwhile, since becoming Representative, Gwion has proven to be consistent with delivering on this promise to share his pay with the district for development.Presenting what many constituents called the first post-war Legislative Report to be made by a Representative of Tchien District, Gwion said he was not about the next election, but for the next generation.In January last year, he announced that as a Representative, he makes US$5,000 (representing 80 percent of his salary) and LR$199,000 (as 20 percent of his salary) thus apportioning to his District US$2,500 and LR$99,500 to account for a month. The essentially unprecedented move to cut his pay has boosted the popularity of Rep. Gwion amongst the people of Tchien District, FPA has learnt.So far, the 50% salary slice has resulted in some meaningful, impactful interventions made by the District Development Council. Some of the interventions are the procurement and installation of the 160KVA transformer now providing electricity to the Martha Tubman Memorial Hospital; donation of 50 bundles of zinc and 50 cartons of nails for the completion of a wing to the rehabilitated Zwedru Central Market; making available cash support to the all-female Gorhai Anu-wlua farmer group in the District; respectively supporting the construction of the Fula and Mandingo Islamic schools; enabling community radio Smile FM have a sustainable power source; and providing funding to four high schools in Zwedru to include Gbargba, Suah Memorial, Mike Tuleh, and Tubman Wilson Institute (TWI) for stationery.In early 2022, Representative Gwion also provided some 62 lights at the cost of US$6,350 for several major streets in Zwedru City, an initiative he said was not only meant to beautify the City, but also increase security in street corners and communities.

Liberia: Sarpo Tribe Expresses Dissatisfaction Over being Left Out in the Design of New Liberian dollars Banknotes,Henry Karmo,"MONROVIA – Some concerned and prominent citizens of Sinoe County, particularly of the Sarpo tribe have expressed dissatisfaction over the makeup and design of the new family of Liberian dollar banknotes in the country.The group, through a communication sent to the Executive Governor of the Central Banks of Liberia (CBL),Aloysius Tarlue, indicated that their attention has been drawn to the new one thousand dollar Liberian banknote which carries the tribes leaving the Sarpo tribe out.By Henry Karmo“We the Eminent Sarpo citizens’ attention has been drawn on the newly printed one thousand bank note being advertised, and profoundly noted that there are sixteen human specimens therein as a representation of the sixteen tribes of Liberia. If this is truly your interpretation of the sixteen human specimen on the one thousand dollars banknotes, then we beg to differ and state categorically that this embodiment is a gross distortion, misrepresentation, and misplacement of historical and demographic facts,” the group stated in their communication to the CBL governor. The group’s communication further stated that empirical evidence from the 2008 census of Liberia clearly indicates that Sarpo is the 17th tribe of the nation, thus, leaving Sarpo out was a complete disservice to the people of said tribe.According to the group’s communication, tribal data are purely and solely dwelled on demographic and anthropological interrogations or findings and not predicating findings on political interpretations or mere histories of human memories.Related Posts Full Text: Alexander Cummings’ 2023 Independence Day…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: LFA Appoints Ethiopian Selam Zeray on a Two-year…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: Armed Forces Operation Against Pirates Attack on a…  Jul 26, 2023 The group indicated “as you may know, many of the writers of the early Liberian histories are not dialectologists and linguists and hence, there’re shortcomings and or inability to adequately understand and write about the early tribesmen and their contributions. Additionally, knowledge is provisional and therefore subject to change based on research and technology.”The group also indicated in their communication to the CBL Governor that when the Bicentennial celebration was being launched, the Chair of the committee and former Chair of the Department of history at the University of Liberia, Professor Dr. C. William Allen made it publicly and unequivocal that owing to the 2008 population and housing survey conducted in Liberia, the nation now has recorded 17 tribes with their various population.“Sarpo accounted for 1.2% of the Liberian Population with forty-three thousand, three hundred and twenty-seven (43,327). With this, Sarpo has been added as the seventeenth tribe of Liberia thus having population supremacy over the Belle and the Dei tribes of Liberia,” the group asserted.Meanwhile, the group stated that as a consequence of all of the historical facts and evidence, the CBL should kindly and hastily adjust the human specimen of sixteen to seventeenth on the one thousand bank notes being advertised to vividly picture or embody the true demographic and historical representation as evidence and reflection of the 2008 population and housing census conducted in Liberia.“Hon. Governor, please be informed, and as earlier mentioned, histories are not stagnant but dynamic, and left with men as time evolves to change the course of histories grounded on evidence and unfolding. It is in view of the foregoing, that we are seeking a modification to the new one thousand bank note been printed and or an amendment to reflect the true tribal representation of the nation,” the group concludedMeanwhile, the group noted that it would soon be writing the Ministry of Education in order to update the country’s tribes from sixteen to seventeen and be thought in all schools across the country.

"Liberia: ‘Forgotten’ Enumerators in Rivercess Demand LISGIS to Pay Just Benefits, Threaten to Disrupt Census?",FPA Staff Reporter,"Solomon Harris, one of the stranded enumerators speaking to a team of FrontPage Africa’s reporters in Boegeezay Township, Rivercess County. Photo credit: Eric Opa DuoeMONROVIA – Over one hundred census workers including supervisors and enumerators are currently stranded in Boegeezay Town, deep inside Rivercess County.By Gerald C. Koinyeneh, [emailprotected] and Eric Opa Doue, [emailprotected] The workers, predominantly youths, between 18 and 35 years, are among 17,000 temporary staff recruited by the Liberia Institute for Statistics and Geo-Information Services (LISGIS) in October to conduct Liberia’s 5th National Population and Housing Census (NPHC).Following the amplitude test, successful candidates were promised stipend to compensate for food and other essentials after a weeklong training. However, LISGIS has failed to live up to its commitment despite waiting patiently for almost 40 days, the recruits told FrontPage Africa. “We have been here for more than one month and ten days. And LISGIS has not sent anything to our mobile money accounts,” said Solomon Harris, one of the enumerators.“As a young man who knows himself, coming here, and bringing myself low, washing dishes and going on people’s old and abandoned cassava farm to dig cassava just to eat is so frustrating. I am feeling bad about this whole government. And I believe that is the same way my colleagues are feeling as well. We have resolved that if we don’t get our money, there will be no field work. No money no census,” Harris added.Almost all of the recruits expressed the same sentiments.“What is going on here is actually disappointing and frustrating. For a renowned institution like LISGIS to abandon us to starve and experience all sorts of hardship is so bad. Since October 10, 2022 we came here to do the workshop, they did not send us anything. We were healthy and happy coming here. But now we are all dry (pale) and angry,” said Benjamin Harmon, another enumerator.Related Posts Full Text: Alexander Cummings’ 2023 Independence Day…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: LFA Appoints Ethiopian Selam Zeray on a Two-year…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: Armed Forces Operation Against Pirates Attack on a…  Jul 26, 2023 Boegeezaye Town is the headquarters of Morweh Statutory District located in Rivercess County Electoral District #1. It is one of the training hubs of LISGIS. From here, several enumerators are expected to be deployed to other parts of the county. According to the distressed recruits, they were about 161 enumerators originally assigned in the area, but because of the continued hardship they are currently experiencing due to LISGIS’ failure to pay they money, most of their colleagues have abandoned their duty and returned home.“We are really suffering here. Some of us came from Monrovia. The first time we went to Cestos. The people told us that our names were not on the list and we were assigned in Yappah Town [another training hub]. Then from Yappah Town, we were told to come here, explained Nuesonpilly GbaKolay,” a female enumerator.Further explaining her ordeal, Gbakolay said: “We came here and were trained for the first time. We stayed for two weeks, no feeding, no stipend. Our director came and told us that the process has been postponed. So, we left. Then we were called back. Since we came back, the story is still the same. And most of our friends have left. Your please talk to the Government and LISGIS to send our money.”Meanwhile, FrontPage Africa has gathered that in addition to LISGIS’s failure to pay the census workers’ money, it has not supplied them with any census materials despite news that the headcount has started in some parts of the country.When contacted, LISGIS did not respond to FrontPage Africa’s inquiry. LISGIS’ acting Director General, Lawrence George did not respond to FPA’s messages sent via WhatsApp.The conduct of Liberia’s overdue NPHC has been marred by controversies and internal wrangling. Recently, President George Weah sacked two top officials of LISGIS, the acting Director General Wilmot Smith and Alex Williams, the Deputy Director General who was placed under suspension when he accused his colleagues including the LISGIS’ Director General Professor Francis Wreh and the current acting head Lawrence George of financial malpractice.Exactly a week after President Weah declared Friday, November 11, 2022 as national census day, the exercise has not started smoothly.Despite the Government of Liberia and its international partners’ assurances that the census was on course, the process is still experiencing glitches.Like the enumerators in Boegeezaye Town, LISGIS has not paid several census workers across the country their stipend.In Grand Cape Mount County, there are reports that the aggrieved enumerators have seized census materials including smartphones. In most parts of the country, census materials are yet to arrive.

Rep. Edward Karfiah Faces Mounting Criticisms: For Calling on Residents of Bong County Not to Vote for “Chickens” in Next Year’s Senate Election?,Selma Lomax,"Rep. Karfia’s statement has drawn the ire of residents, with many calling on him to apologize or face the consequences at the ballot box next year in October.GBARNGA, Bong County – District Five lawmaker Edward Karfiah is facing mounting criticisms for calling on residents of Bong County “not to elect chickens and nincompoops” in next year’s senatorial election.Asked by a reporter Saturday about the names of aspirants vying to become senator of Bong County, Karfiah, a senatorial aspirant, replied: “Bong County is not a place for chickens and nincompoops. The people of the county have learned their lessons.” The lawmaker’s statement has drawn the ire of residents, with many calling on him to apologize or face their consequences at the ballot box next year October.Jefferson Gbaryan, a former senatorial candidate of Bong County, told FrontPageAfrica: “Politics is about the exchange of platforms and not insults. To have branded his fellow aspirants as “chickens” and “nincompoops” shows the lawmaker’s desperation for power,” he said.“How can a man who claims he wants to reconcile Bong County be calling his fellow contestants with such a name? How will he reconcile Bong County when he’s elected? I’m calling on residents of Bong County to reject Edward Karfiah because by that comment he has proven not to be the best choice for the Senate.”Jerry Forkpa, a resident of Gbarnga, told FrontPageAfrica: “Rep. Karfiah spoke as if he had planned to target a particular aspirant whom he sees as his rival in the pending election. He may have spoken out of frustration. If he doesn’t apologize to the people of Bong County I will campaign against him.”Former Bong County Inspector William B. S Kollie told Premium FM, a local radio station in Gbarnga. “You know someone is desperate for power when a remark of such is made without any remorse. Being political rivals doesn’t mean hate and animosity. What the lawmaker has said shows who he is.”The criticisms directed at the People’s Unification Party (PUP) lawmaker come at a time he’s facing mounting backlash from his own partisans and residents of the county for declaring support for the re-election bid of President George Weah.Related Posts Full Text: Alexander Cummings’ 2023 Independence Day…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: “Our democracy is under threat” – Alexander…  Jul 25, 2023 Liberia: Minister Sonii Extols Bea Mountain for Constructing…  Jul 22, 2023 Partisans of the PUP are condemning the lawmaker’s decision, saying it wasn’t in the interest of Liberia. Partisan Samuel Flomo told FrontPageAfrica: “For our lawmaker to declare support for the re-election of President Weah when the current living conditions of the people of Bong County and Liberia are worsening by the day due to poor governance says it all about his vision for the country. For me as member of the PUP, I won’t support his Senate bid because he has clearly demonstrated he supports the hardship being meted against us by this government.”Eric Tokpa (not a relative to incumbent Bong County senator Henrique Tokpa), also a member of the PUP, told FrontPageAfrica. “Declaring support for a government that doesn’t pay civil servants on time, a government that hasn’t done much for the people of Bong County since it came to power in 2018, and declaring support for a government that has failed to appoint any cabinet minister from Bong County since the dismissal of former agriculture minister Dr. Mogana Flomo in 2019 says it all about a man who wants to represent the people of Bong County at the Senate,” he said.Why the odds for the Senate against KarfiahWith less than a year to the much-anticipated Senate race, there are a lot of factors playing against the District Five lawmaker.His decision to support representative aspirants against incumbent lawmakers seeking re-elections appears to be taking a toll on his ambition. In District One, Karfiah’s decision to support Wamah Kuteh at the expense of Representative Albert Hills has reportedly forced the lawmaker to endorse former senator Henry Yallah, who finished second in the 2020 senatorial election.Such decision has reportedly put him at loggerheads with influential representative aspirant Prince Kwenah, who’s poised to support the Senate ambition of businesses Johnny Kpehe.In District Three, relationship between the PUP lawmaker and Rep. Marvin Cole has gone frosty after they were involved in a spat in the Plenary of the House of Representatives. Rep. Cole has vowed to campaign against Rep. Karfiah.District Six lawmaker Moima Briggs-Mensah has already gone public with her endorsement of Kpehe at the expense of Rep. Karfiah, while Senator Prince Moye, the only lawmaker in Bong County not going for election in 2023 because of his nine-year tenure, could campaign against Rep.

We note the importance of bringing together motorcyclists and tricyclists who are indeed key and relevant to stakeholders in the transformation process.”He urged the participants to be proactive and continue to anticipate, monitor and curtail prevailing situations that could escalate to conflict or chaos.He added that acts that could escalate to tensions must be avoided at all times.Mr. Quaqua further urged the riders of motorcycles and tricycles to see what they are doing as means of livelihood.He said though the sustenance of peace remains critical to government, it requires the collective efforts of all citizens to ensure that Liberia remains peaceful and stable.For her part, the Country Manager of theCatholic Relief Service ( CRS) Abena Amedormey observed that commercial motorbike and tricycle riding plays a role in the socio-economic development of the nation.She said the contributions being made by these citizens should not only be noticed, but it should also be respected by others.“Now people who are not riders, will not understand the pressure and the stresses you experience in an attempt to make ends mean so you people are very importance in the society”, she added.She, however, pledged her organization’s support and commitment to working with the leadership and members of the group as “close partners” to accelerate the growth and development of the society.Madam Amedormey said her group will continue to provide support for expansion and capacity building for members of the Federation of Motorcycles and Tricycle Unions of Liberia (FOMTUL).She commended the USAID, through its Deputy Country Director to Liberia Dr. Mandy Dagold for the guidance and support towards efforts being applied by the CRS to address issues faced by communities in Liberia.Dr. Dagold, however, expressed gratitude to the participants for the formulation of the resolution.She said: “It’s truly an honor to see motorcyclists from across the nation come together to sign a joint resolution committing members of the motorcyclist Union to maintain peace in the Country.” ",18/11/2022,https://frontpageafricaonline.com/news/over-200-commit-to-sustaining-peace-in-liberia%ef%bf%bc/,1

Rosemart: The Logging Company Secretly Operating in Nimba,Gerald C. Koinyeneh,"Rose Yancy and community people lead foreigners into the Kpaytuo Plantation. Photo credit: Facebook/Rose YancyKPAYTUO, Nimba County – A Liberian-owned company ships timber from a forest in Nimba County unknown to the rest of the public, except for the Managing Director of the Forestry Development Authority (FDA) Mike Doryen and the other top managers of the agency, who have sanctioned the firm’s illegal operations.Rosemart Inc.was awarded the Kpaytuo Plantation in the Saclepea District at least six years ago, according to documents withheld secret ever since until a recent investigation by The DayLight prompted the FDA to publish them. The company has illegally shipped US$100,000 worth of teak logs, expensive woods used for construction, shipbuilding and the making of rifles.By Gerald C. Koinyeneh for The DayLightAt the time of Rosemart’s last known shipment in 2020, teaks were selling for US$300 per cubic meter. It has traded between US$1-2.5 million goodson the Trade Key alone, a Saudi Arabia-based e-commerce platform. But there is no public record of Romsemart’s operations—its contracts with the FDA and the community where it operates—except for three illegal export permits. The company is not captured in the reports of the Liberia Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (LEITI). It has only paid US$664.70 during all its years of operations, with some of its fees going straight to the FDA’s account at the United Bank for Africa (UBA), instead of the Liberia Revenue Authority (LRA). Villagers adjacent to the Kpaytuo Plantation said Rosemart pays them US$15,000 for a certain quantity of logs. They said they have had three transactions, information backed by the permits published so far. The 500-acre Kpaytuo is one of several plantations across the country that were established by the government of Liberia prior to the Liberian civil wars as part of the government’s forest regeneration program.“The agreement puts Rosemart in charge of the forest. The few pieces [of logs] that remained there, she is responsible for them. I heard that she has found partners and is waiting for the rain to stop coming,” said Adolphus Kpangar, the commissioner of Kpaytuo township. He declined to share a copy of the agreement.The FDA awarded Rosemart’s its contracts outside of forestry laws and regulations. There are five legal logging permits: forest management contracts (FMC), timber sale contracts (TSC), forest use permits (FUP) or private use permits (PUP) and a community forest management agreement (CFMA). Rosemart contract does not fall under any of the five contracts, known in the sector as forest resource licenses.Related Posts Full Text: Alexander Cummings’ 2023 Independence Day…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: LFA Appoints Ethiopian Selam Zeray on a Two-year…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: Armed Forces Operation Against Pirates Attack on a…  Jul 26, 2023 Rosemart did not conduct an environmental social impact assessment (ESIA) as mandated by the National Forestry Reform Law. The assessment draws out the environmental and social consequences of a project and proposes measures to mitigate potential negative impacts. Clearing a forest without conducting an ESIA could hurt plants, animals and people, experts say. For instance, Kpaytuo Plantation has swamps, generally important ecosystems that are home to different species.Also, Rosemart’s export permits were issued outside of thechain of custodyor LiberTrace, the system that tracks all logs produced and shipped from Liberia. Its creation was a monumental achievement in Liberia’s drive to trade legal and sustainable logs. It is a crucial component of the country’sVoluntary Partnership Agreement (VPA) with the European Union signed in 2011.“I have no idea what [those permits are],” said Gertrude Nyaley, the technical manager for the department in an emailed interview with The DayLight. “What I know is that all woods and wood products must be exported [through] the LiberTrace system. Anything shipment of timber or timber products outside the chain-of-custody system is illegal.” Awarding permits outside the chain of custody amounts to economic sabotage under the law.  Rose Yancy Adikwu, Rosemart’s co-owner and CEO, turned down an interview with The DayLight on her company’s illegal activities.The FDA did not initially respond to The DayLight’s inquiry. But in a rebuttal to ourinvestigationthat exposed the secret deal, it falsely claimed that Rosemart’s consignment did not meet certain requirements. It also claimed that Société Générale de Surveillance (SGS), the Swiss firm that created LiberTrace, declined to enter the teak logs from plantations into the chain of custody.Contrary to this claim, Rosemart made a number of shipments that are much larger than some of the ones captured by the LEITI. For instance, Rosemart exported 88.625 cubic meters of logs outside the chain of custody in 2020. That same year, Regnals Internationals Inc.—which runs the Cavalla Reforestation Plantation—exported only 62 cubic meters of logs. Rose Yancy Adikwu, Rosemart’s co-owner and CEO with townsmen and her foreign business partners. Facebook/Rose Yancy AdikwuSGS alsodebunkedthe FDA’s claim it declined to register the logs Rosemart exported into the system. “SGS has never been informed of any scientific management plantations to be applied in LiberTrace,” Theodore Aime Nna, SGS’ forestry project manager, told The DayLight. “Moreover, SGS does not certify any log in Liberia, but only verifies their history…” This story was originally published by The DayLight and has been republished here by permission.

Liberia: Vote-rich Nimba County Senators Contemplate Withdrawing Support from CDC ahead of 2023 Elections,Henry Karmo,"MONROVIA – Nimba County Senator Jeremiah Kpan-Koung says he and his political leader, Senator Prince Y. Johnson, are unsure about their support for President George Weah’s second term bid in the 2023 presidential and general elections.Senator Johnson’s Movement for Democracy and Reconstruction (MDR) was pivotal in securing Pres. Weah’s victory in the 2017 runoff election. Speaking on Voice of Gompa over the weekend, Senator Koung said he and Sen. Johnson are not happy about the treatment Nimbaians are getting from the CDC-led government.Sen. Koung: “I am not happy with the CDC Government.“Up to now, I am supporting President Weah but, this could change depending on the result of the negotiation on behalf of our people. Sen. Prince Y. Johnson, my political leader, is not also happy with the government, we are reviewing the MDR marriage with the Coalition, in terms of what have we benefited as a party.”According to the Nimba Senator, he spoke the minds of most Nimbaians who feel betrayed by the CDC government, especially in the allotment of positions in the government. He said Nimbaians are disappointed that most of the appointments in government have gone to the South easterners where the President hails from.The Nimba County Senators believe that over the five years of Weah’s administration, his Nimbaians have been denied opportunities including appointed positions in the CDC-led Government.Koung’s statement comes in the wake of rumors that Mr. Alexander Cummings of the Alternative National Congress (ANC) was considering picking Koung as a running mate in the pending 2023 presidential and general elections.Senator Johnson, sanctioned by the United States Treasury Department, is known for his influence as the ‘godfather’ of the vote-rich Nimba county as leverage to impose on President George Weah appointments into government as he desires.The Nimba County Senator has been behind a number of bad appointments and recommendations for key jobs in the Weah-led government.This is reportedly raising concerns within leadership’s inner circle as the former warlord-turned Senator is said to be using vote-rich Nimba’s influence on 2023 elections in a bid to force allies into government despite being nailed on US Treasury Department’s Sanctions List.It is also believed that Sen. Johnson is one of the key obstructions to the establishment of war crimes court in Liberia. He is known to be the killer of former President Samuel Doe. General Johnson at the time is seen in a video sipping on a jar of beer while the former President was being stripped naked by his men and his ears chopped of.Feeling EntitledRelated Posts Full Text: Alexander Cummings’ 2023 Independence Day…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: LFA Appoints Ethiopian Selam Zeray on a Two-year…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: Armed Forces Operation Against Pirates Attack on a…  Jul 26, 2023 Nimba County, according to the 2008 National Housing and Population Census, had a population of about 462,026. From the National Elections Commission (NEC) 2017 statistics, Nimba had a voting population of 279,601, of this number, 200,791 votes were cast in the county.Despite the presence of 20 Presidential candidates in that 2017 presidential race, the Unity Party was led by Vice President Joseph Boakai and Senator Weah, who headed the CDC, were inarguably the heavyweights in that election, but still Senator Johnson was overwhelmingly voted for by kinsmen and women in Nimba.He attained 107,430 votes of the 200,791 votes that were cast. That constituted 53.5% of the overall votes in the county. The margin between Senator Johnson and Vice President Boakai, who came out second in Nimba was a 67,466 difference. VP Boakai obtained 39,964 votes.Senator Johnson’s support to Pres. Weah in the second round of the election saw Pres. Weah attain an overwhelming victory in the election.Senator Johnson is on record for expressing his regrets for rallying the vote-rich Nimba in support of President Weah. However, pundits say this has been his strategy to get the President in line with his demands.It can be recalled that in August 2020, while expressing his regrets, Sen. Johnson walked out of the Senate’s confirmation proceedings for a new Superintendent of Nimba County. President George Weah had appointed Mr. Nelson N. Korquoi to replace outgoing Dorr Cooper. Cooper is said to be a supporter of Sen. Johnson.“I don’t want confusion; you all know the level of work I did in Nimba to get President Weah elected. In 2005 and 2011, the people of Nimba didn’t vote for CDC. In 2017, everything almost went to the other candidate; my support for the CDC brought the victory,” Sen. Johnson said.Sanctioned for CorruptionIn December 2021, Sen. Johnson was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department for corruption under the Global Magnitsky Act, which authorizes the U.S. government to sanction those it sees as human rights offenders, freeze their assets, and ban them from entering the U.S.Johnson was responsible for the slaying in 1990 of President Samuel Doe, who had been captured by his forces at the Freeport of Monrovia in 1990. Johnson sipped beer as he watched his men torture and mutilate Doe who begged in vain for mercy in a widely circulated video.Now a trusted political ally of President George Weah, Johnson is accused in a U.S. embassy statement of large-scale corruption.“As a senator, Johnson has been involved in pay-for-play funding with government ministries and organizations for personal enrichment,” a statement issued by the U.S. embassy said. “As part of the scheme, upon receiving funding from the government of Liberia, the involved government ministries and organizations launder a portion of the funding for return to the involved participants.”The scheme involves millions of dollars, according to the embassy statement.Johnson also receives an undeserved salary from the Liberian government as a salaried intelligence source yet he does not provide any form of intelligence reporting, alleged the U.S. statement. He is being paid in order to maintain domestic stability, according to the statement.“Johnson has also offered the sale of votes in multiple Liberian elections in exchange for money,” it said.

Liberia: McGill Gives Reason Why He Wants to Be Senator in Margibi County,Obediah Johnson,"MONROVIA – Former Minister of State for Presidential Affairs says his foremost reason for wanting to contest the senatorial seat of Margibi County is to reconcile the county’s leadership and residents of the county.Last week, Mr. McGill accepted a petition from thousands of citizens in the county to join the race to replace incumbent Senator Jim Tornolah in the pending 2023 presidential and legislative elections. Liberians are expected to go to the polls to elect their new leaders on October 10, 2023, according to a timetable released by the National Elections Commission (NEC).Mr. McGill consistent empowerment initiatives being undertaken in the county have made him uneven with scores of other elected officials of the county.Speaking when he appeared on Farmington Radio in the county on Sunday, November 6, Mr. McGill attributed his decision to the need to help reconcile citizens of the county.“We have come to work with the leadership of Margibi, companies and the leadership and members of the legislative caucus to solve problems. We are not here to divide our people; we are here to unite our people. Margibi has lots of problems.”“Everyone has a stake in Margibi and we can’t do with division. That’s the purpose for which I’m coming to Margibi. There are lots of problems that need to be solved than just fighting each other.”He cautioned his supporters against attacking others who do not support his ambition“Reconciliation is cardinal and you see it in my attitude. Democracy requires the exchange of ideas and disagreement. Disagreement is civility and it doesn’t mean we are enemies. We should find a way to solve our problems than to fight.”Mr. McGill maintained that though there may be disagreements ahead of the elections, citizens should avoid disagreeing or taking steps or actions to fuel disunity in the county.Aftermath of divisionHe stated that citizens of the county will continue to suffer if their leaders are divided.“You get the right to disagree with me respectfully. For the good of Margibi, we can disagree. But that disagreement should be for the unity of Margibi and not to divide us.”“If we are not unity Margibi will suffer. Nobody should be misled to believe that a single individual or Nathaniel McGill is going to solve all the problems of Margibi; it’s not possible.”Mr. McGill said the “best brains and other citizens” should hold together and collectively work in finding solutions to the challenges confronting them and the county in general.“Margibi is a county of immigrants and hospitality. We come from all over and we embrace all citizens. All the counties are represented in Margibi and so, Margibi County is the breadbasket of brains.”“We are bringing unity and you can’t overemphasize the need for unity in any community or society. And so, Margibi will be of no exception in terms of uniting the citizens. Everybody has a stake in Margibi and plates on the table. Margibi have too many brains in this county and we cannot allow those brains to waste.”Better retirement packageHe further vowed to fight to ensure that employees of concession companies receive better packages after following their retirement.“There are too many opportunities; our people need jobs and the issue of retirement benefits for employees in the concession areas. Our people work so hard and when they are retired, they should get better retirement benefits. Those are the things we will be fighting for since in fact, this area employs lot of people.”He maintained that retirees should enjoy the “fruits of their labor” after serving their employers for several decades.EducationMeanwhile, Mr. Mcgill has provided university scholarships to over 100 recent graduates of the Harbel Multilateral High School.He served as the guest speaker at the school recent graduation and closing convocation.He disclosed that the move was a “moral obligation” in fulfillment of his unbending quest to support education and help alleviate some of the constraints parents are faced with in furthering their children’s education in the post-conflict nation.“I was born as a very poor child and my parents couldn’t afford to send me to school. My father died when I was at the age of nine years old and my mother struggled to send me to school. She had to sell charcoal and potato greens to find school fees for me to go. I know the sufferings our parents are going through to find jobs and something to send their children to school.”Mr. McGill disclosed that investment in education remains one of his foremost priorities in the county.“Investing in people is not only to give them economic power; but if you have education, you can be able to do anything for yourself.”Related Posts Full Text: Alexander Cummings’ 2023 Independence Day…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: LFA Appoints Ethiopian Selam Zeray on a Two-year…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: Armed Forces Operation Against Pirates Attack on a…  Jul 26, 2023 He said women’s empowerment; including the provision of opportunities to accord them the opportunity to advance their studies remain keen on his agenda.“I will fight for the rights of women anywhere I go and female education is a priority. When you educate a woman, you educate a nation and women’s education is a big, big issue. We want to encourage our women to go to school.”Mr. McGill observed that though the government has made the University of Liberia a tuition-free higher institution of learning, many people still cannot afford to enroll or pay their fees.He disclosed that he will continue to lobby with others to provide scholarship opportunities to those who are in need.He used the medium to urge young people to take their education seriously if they must be productive citizens in the future.“As long as I live, I will continue to support education. Even if I am leaving, a lot of people will send a foundation for their future. Education is the bedrock of any society. When you have a sound foundation or education, you can be anyone. That’s why I’m defining education to be my priority area. I want to be remembered as the Nathaniel McGill who supported education.”Mr. McGill said leaders of the county should continue to exert efforts towards providing educational opportunities for citizens, especially young people.He emphasized that though he intends to undertake and continue other initiatives in the county, he will also support the education of rural women in a bid to make Liberia a strong nation.Why Margibi?Mr. McGill’s stealthy move to galvanize the support of the locals in Margibi barely a few weeks after he was sanctioned by the United States Treasury Department for alleged acts of corruption, raised concerns among former and current elected officials of the county.He has also engaged in numerous initiatives including the dashing of cash to empower women and youths in the county.But some former and current elected officials of Margibi, including former Senator Clarice Jah, have called on Mr. McGill to abandon his quest from contest and concentrate on clearing his name from the US sanction list.They warned against the use of their county as a “dust bin” to accommodate and push Mr. McGill to a political office.They questioned the rationale behind the decision taken by the former Minister of State for Presidential Affairs to abandon his home, Gbarpolu County to contest for an elected position in Margibi.Mr. McGill contested the Mid-Term Senatorial elections in Gbarpolu County in 2014 on the ticket of the opposition Congress for Democratic Change (CDC). He accumulated 1, 636 votes or 14.2% over his victor Senator Daniel Naatehn of the Alternative National Congress (ANC) who got 3,962 or 34.3%.He came third, out of seven persons who contested for the seat.His decision taken to abandon Gbarpolu to contest in Margibi County, other than nearby areas, continue to raise speculations and doubts about his chances of winning.Force to clarifySenator Emmanuel Nuquay, Political Leader of the People’s Unification Party (PUP) is one of those who is also reportedly opposing the ascendancy of Mr. McGill to the Liberian Senate to join him in representing the people of Margibi at the 54thNational Legislature.Sources have hinted that Senator Nuquay, who is seen as the “political godfather” of Margibi would appear to be losing his “stronghold to a stranger” since in fact, he (Nuquay) wants to contest the presidency in the future.He contested as Vice Presidential candidate to Joseph Nyuma Boakai of the Unity Party (UP) in 2017.In September this year, Senator Nuquay described rumors that he was supporting the ambition of Mr. McGill as a “stranger on job hunt”, and urged residents of the county to “shine their eyes” ahead of 2023 legislative and presidential elections.Clarifying his innocence to residents of the county at a town hall gathering in Kakata, Senator Nuquay insisted he has no idea about McGill’s senatorial ambition, saying “I can’t take the Margibi people’s job and give it to a stranger.”“I have been accused of taking someone (the former Minister of State for Presidential Affairs Nathaniel McGill) from the Belleh Forest to bring him to the Gibi Mountain to take the Margibian (name for residents of the county) children’s job. I want to assure you that the information is untrue. I have no idea about Mr. McGill’s senatorial ambition,” Senator Nuquay said.Liberia’s political landscape has dramatically turned to the showcasing of political strength geographically.Already, various politicians are grabbing hold of various counties by grounding themselves and engaging into multiple initiatives to be seen as the “political godfathers” of those regions.Senators Nyonblee Karnga Lawrence, Edwin Snowe, Prince Moye, and Prince Johnson are presenting themselves as the “political godfathers” of Grand Bassa, Bomi, Bong and Nimba Counties.These lawmakers have become politically grounded in their respective counties, making it very difficult to have them or candidates of their choice easily defeated during elections or any other decision making processes in their respective counties.Senator Nuquay, who is reported to also be eyeing the presidency in 2029, is rallying the support of influential leaders and others in the county to prevent the ascendancy of Mr. McGill to the Liberian Senate.However, more efforts need to be applied to actualize the concerted plan of these former and current elected officials of Margibi County since in fact, Mr. Mcgill has gotten popular in a very short period of time in the county as evidenced by the huge turnout during his recent petitioning ceremony.

Liberia: 120 Youth Selected in Sinoe and Bassa To Serve As Ecobrigade ,Press Release,"MONROVIA – Human activities and natural disasters can create erosion and all sorts of harm to the environment. Just like many countries, the situation remains the same in Liberia. To curtail this, the Society for the Conservation of Nature of Liberia (SCNL), with support from the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), has been working with a brand of youth for environmental ecosystem protection.120 youth, known as “Youth Ecobrigade” have been selected from Sinoe and, Grand Bassa Counties respectively to help protect the seashore and the communities.The Youth Ecobrigade in Sinoe County was named: ‘Snokrol Ecobrigade’ meaning “Inside Here We Live”. While the Youth Ecobrigade in Grand Bassa County was named: ‘Gbehzohn Ecobrigade’. During the selection processes, SCNL and the local officials of the counties were present to ensure the selections were done fairly.

This is my first time seeing our Liberian Money. We don’t see our money because of the bad roads. We go to Sierra Leone to buy and do business. This loan given to me by SCNL will be used to increase my market, and I will work hard to repay the loan. I tell SCNL thank you very much for your help.

Liberia: Charlyne Brumskine Declares Political Interest In District#3 Grand Bassa County,FPA Staff Reporter,"MONROVIA – Cllr. Charlyne Brumskine has broken her silence, saying she will contest on the ticket of the Collaborating Political Party (CPP) during the 2023 legislative and presidential elections in Grand Bassa’s third district.The Liberty Party, whose founding political leader Charles Brumskine is Charlyne’s late father, has been enmeshed in a long-standing legal and political battle that has seen the Supreme Court ruled in Musa Bility’s favor as the legitimate chairman of the party despite attempts by Senator Nyonblee Karnga-Lawrence to have him expelled. The political impasse has seen the Liberty Party factionalized, with Senator Karngar-Lawrence of Grand Bassa County and Monsterrado County Senator Abraham Darius Dillon supporting the presidential ambition of the standard bearer of Unity Party Joseph Boakai, while Bility on one hand is supporting the presidential ambition of the standard bearer of the Alternative National Congress (ANC) Alexander Cummings, who was nominated as the standard bearer of the CPP.It has been left to see which side of the divide would Charlyne choose to contest on ahead of 2023.Related Posts Full Text: Alexander Cummings’ 2023 Independence Day…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: LFA Appoints Ethiopian Selam Zeray on a Two-year…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: Armed Forces Operation Against Pirates Attack on a…  Jul 26, 2023 In a letter written to Bility, Charlyne declared her interest to contest the CPP-Liberty Party ticket in Grand Bassa County District #3 election “following consultations with immediate family, friends, and well-wishers”.“After prayerful and careful consideration and lengthy deliberations with my mother, Estelle V.

"Ruling Party’s Lawmaker Expresses Opposition to Nathaniel McGill’s Senatorial Bid, Says ‘Margibi County Not Dumping Ground For Criminals’",Gerald C. Koinyeneh,"DOLO TOWN, Margibi County – Representative Tibelrosa S. Taponweh (District ONE, Margibi County), a member of the ruling Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC) has openly voiced his opposition to those calling on disgraced former Presidential Affairs Minister Nathaniel McGill to run for the county’s only senatorial seat up for grabs in 2023.Ex-Minister McGill was one of three top officials of the Weah-administration slapped with damning sanctions by the United States Government for their alleged role in public corruption in Liberia. He, along with the other two alleged culprits, Bill Twehway, former Managing Director of the National Port Authority (NPA) and Cllr. Syrenius Cephus, former Liberian Solicitor General resigned amid sustained pressure from the public.Following his resignation, Minister McGill continued to visit Margibi County frequently, making public appearances and amassing large crowds. His supporters and some CDC loyalists have called on him to contest the county’s senatorial seat in 2023.While he has not responded, observers believe his frequent visit to Kakata, the county’s political seat, is an indication that he is considering to run.However, in a rare rebuke, Rep. Tarponweh has called on partisans has called on eligible voters of Margibi to reject McGill, once considered the most powerful figure within the CDC-led Government.Rep. Tarponweh, who also chairs the County’s Legislative Caucus said Margibi is not a hideout for criminals and cautioned McGill to avoid the public space and seek repentance.“If the Americans said that you are the most corrupt man in Liberia, I think you need to get out of the public space. Our view is that this brother (McGill) should not be thinking about contesting. He should go and seek repentance to clear his name. Margibi is not a dumping ground for criminals,” he said, while addressing a gathering at the Dolo Town Intellectual Forum in Margibi on Sunday.Lavish LifestyleRelated Posts Full Text: Alexander Cummings’ 2023 Independence Day…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: LFA Appoints Ethiopian Selam Zeray on a Two-year…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: Armed Forces Operation Against Pirates Attack on a…  Jul 26, 2023 In his capacity as Minister of State for Presidential Affairs and President Weah’s Chief-of-staff, McGill led a lavish lifestyle, amassing huge properties in Monsterrado and other rural counties. He was always seen making huge cash donation to students and rural women. He claimed the money was ditched out on behalf of President Weah.In one of his last public appearances as Minister, he told a group of women in Bong County that he sees nothing wrong with public officials stealing public money so long they are giving it back to the citizens, and not taking it out of the country.Rep. Tarponweh cautioned Liberians to desist from celebration these sanctioned officials as doing so would send a bad signal. He said the decision taken by the United States to sanction the top three government officials was intended to save Liberia from further exploitation, and such Liberians should not be celebrating them.“Our greatest ally took him out of the President’s Office because of corruption. He is a threat to the development of Liberia. What does that mean? I can say the President was helped by the United States of America to save our Country.Our ally has been cooperating with us on many fronts. Those people who were sanctioned stole from you the Margibi citizens,” he said.The Margibi Lawmaker told residents to collect the “stolen” money from the former Minister and make the best decision in the interest of the county.“After acquiring ill-gotten wealth, they will be spending the stolen money. That’s your money; take it. Walk away and make the best decision in the interest of Margibi. During elections, you alone will be behind the ballot.”Nathaniel McGill and two other officials of government (Syrenius Cephus & Bill Twehway) were sanctioned the United States of America for engaging into corruption including misappropriation of state assets, bribery, taking private assets for personal gain, among others.The US Treasury said, during his tenure in government, McGill received bribes from potential investors, and accepted kickbacks for steering contracts to companies in which he had interest. He also manipulated public procurement process in order to award multi-million-dollar contracts to companies in which he has ownership, including by abusing emergency procurement process to rig contract bids and other offences.Under the sanction, all properties and interests in properties of the three officials in the US were blocked and reported to the US Treasury, while people who engage in any transactions with the officials may be subject to sanctions as well.

Truce At Last: Sen. Moye Reunites Two Rival Bong Diaspora Groups,Selma Lomax,"United States of America – At long last, Bong County Senator Prince Kermue Moye, Sr. has reunited Bong County citizens residing in the United States of America following months of bitterness.There has been internal bickering amongst Bong citizens in the Americas over electoral procedures since the convention of the United Bong County Association in America (UBCAA) a few months ago which brought to power Mr. Caimon Joe Kollie.The situation led to the creation of another faction of the UBCAA (“The National Bong County Association in the Americas”), thus making it impossible for the two groups to agree to work together.After months of negotiations, Senator Moye finally brought the two groups together in the spirit of togetherness during his recent visit to the United States of America.During the reconciliation forum, the two parties agreed to settle the matter and work together for the forward march of the organization and in the spirit of oneness.According to a dispatch from the US, the parties agreed to the following during the resolution:Related Posts Full Text: Alexander Cummings’ 2023 Independence Day…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: LFA Appoints Ethiopian Selam Zeray on a Two-year…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: Armed Forces Operation Against Pirates Attack on a…  Jul 26, 2023 1. That the Caimon Joe Kollie leadership is recognized as the legitimate leadership of the UBCAA;2. That the Delaware Valley chapter be represented on the Board of the UBCAA;3. That the UBCAA constitution shall be reviewed at the next convention to reflect current realities;4. That both parties issue a joint statement encouraging ALL supporters to endorse the outcomes of the mediation agreement; and5. That Senator Moye, Sr. Will liaise with the Bong Legislative Caucus to raise 3,000USD (three thousand United States Dollars) to offset the expenses incurred by the Delaware Valley chapter.Meanwhile, Bong County citizens at home and abroad have commended Senator Moye for his effort in reverting the UBCAA to status quo after a few months of power struggle.Some believed that the move by Senator Moye is not only in the interest of the parties involved but the county as a whole, considering the fact that those involved are also sons and daughters of the county despite their locations.

Liberia: Killings Among Couples Soar In Bong County?,Selma Lomax,"Gbarnga, Bong County – Domestic homicides, or murder by an intimate partner, are gradually assuming an alarming dimension in Bong County, with reports of the death of one or both partners in the resultant fisticuffs.Investigation revealed that women are more likely to be killed by an intimate partner, be her husband, an ex, or a boyfriend, than anyone else. Sometimes, innocent children who did not beg to be brought into the world end up having their lives snuffed out of them by either of the partners, apparently to erase memories of the bitter days.Investigation by the Crimes Services Department of the Bong County Police Detachment revealed that between January 2015 and October 2022, more than 56 cases of domestic homicides have been recorded in the county, with three in the month of October 2022.Investigation further showed that in most cases, anger, jealousy, depression and abuse of drugs have been the propelling force behind these unwarranted deaths.Last week, residents of Goll Farm on the Melekie-Gbarnga highway woke up to find the lifeless body of 63-year-old Nowai Yarkpawolo. This shock was not in her death but the circumstances surrounding it, as she was alleged to have been strangled to death by her 58-year-old husband, Kokolu Kpaquoi, during a misunderstanding over LD$ 500 of his cane juice money which his wife reportedly mismanaged. The disagreement degenerated into a fight.One version of the account alleged that the late Nowai had grabbed a machete to scare her husband during the fight, but that the latter overpowered her, causing the machete to fall off her grip. Kokolu reportedly pinned her by the neck and strangled her to death in the process.Another account revealed that Kokolu killed his wife with machete after discovering she had mismanaged his money.However, another version of the account claimed the deceased might have slumped and died out of exhaustion during the quarrel.Question on the lips of neighbors is what could have warranted couple of that age, who are supposed to be counselors and mentors to young couples , to have engaged in a fight that went awry.Love turns bitter in countyRelated Posts Full Text: Alexander Cummings’ 2023 Independence Day…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: LFA Appoints Ethiopian Selam Zeray on a Two-year…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: Armed Forces Operation Against Pirates Attack on a…  Jul 26, 2023 Love is one of the most profound emotions known to human beings. Unfortunately, some persons got entangled in it but ended up realizing too late that it was a death trap.In Bong County, Liberia and elsewhere in the world, the story is the same. One moment, it feels like both parties could not do without each other, and in another moment, one of the parties ends up in regret, that is, if life is not snuffed out of him or her, either due to anger induced by jealousy, or frustration of not getting a reciprocal feeling from the other.Back home in Bong County, in 2021, a jealous lover identified Dolo Kollie, 35, allegedly stabbed his wife, Hawa Yarkpawolo to death in Botota, Kokoyah Statutory District.Reason? He accused her of picking up a call from another man.Relatives of the deceased said Kollie and his wife were engaged in a verbal altercation when a call from a man whom Hawa described as a casual friend came in.This sparked up a renewed rage, as her jealous lover, according to relatives, started beating her and in the process, stabbed her with a knife in the back and abandoned her to die.Before being charged with murder by police in Bong, he apologized to the deceased’s family in an emotionally-filled interview he had with journalists.“I feel very hurt, very unhappy at the moment. I want to ask my wife’s parents and relatives to forgive me, it wasn’t my intention to do what I did. I acted on jealousy after I was misinformed by my friends that my wife was into an extra relationship with someone from a neighboring town,” said Kollie.In May 2020, A man confessed to shooting his long-time girlfriend to death. Police said the death of Fatu Yarkpah, 29, a resident of Mansansue Town in Salala District, said Friday that they had arrested the victim’s boyfriend, Jacob Nyumah.Jacob, 50, admitted to FrontPageAfrica Friday to succumbing to rage after discovering that his girlfriend had been cheating on him. “I shot my girlfriend after I noticed that she had a different boyfriend. I begged her on many occasions to leave the boyfriend and she refused. So, I got angry and shot her in her chest with my single-barrel gun,” he said.He said he had confronted his girlfriend with evidence of her cheating on him with another man. “I saw a photo of her and the boyfriend in her phone when I confronted her about the evidence she denied,” he said.Joshua said they had a fight over what happened and the last straw was his girlfriend, with whom they have been together for nine years, told him she had fooled him for a long time.Several other cases, most of which are in court abound. From the foregoing, it is obvious that domestic homicide accounts for a number of deaths in not just Bong County and elsewhere in the globe.

Many dogs also lost their lives immediately after eating the dead fish, the residents said.Speaking to journalists, the residents of the Jikardor Town called on the government to come to their rescue and ensure the relocation of the town as a result of the Bea Mountain Mining Company chemical spill.“We want the government to help relocate us because we were advised by the Environmental Protection Agency not to use the river and hand-pumps. Dry season is almost here and we are afraid before something major happens to us, especially the children,” Alieu Getaweh, spokesperson of one of the Jikardor Town said.According to Getaweh, the adults may decide not to go to the waterside but it’s difficult to control the children, adding that relocation of the town will end any future deaths or problems.Apart from the Jikardor River, there is swamp water that was tested by the Environmental Protection Agency and was urged for residents to use. The residents say the swamp will dry in November, therefore it is prudent for the government to take action by relocating them.“If Bea Mountain is prepared to relocate us, we will identify a place. We don’t want for something to happen to a child or our children before the government can relocate us,” Getaweh said.Though Bea Mountain earlier denied being responsible for the pollution of the rivers. However, staff of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said the chemical called Cyanide was used to wash gold but dangerous to human health was allegedly spilled from the company’s new Liberty Gold Mine in Kinjor and emptied into the rivers that villagers used for cooking, fishing, and washing.Alieu Getaweh, spokesperson of the Jikardor Town, said there are 350 residents that are greatly being affected. The Bea Mountain supplies them with water but adding that the provision of the water supply is very low.He furthers: “The Company recently provided 61 sacks of water which is insufficient for the many residents.”He said since the town was mandated not to drink from the creek and the hand-pumps, the leadership urged the company to help build a reservoir to assist in supplying them water but the request is yet to materialize.Related Posts Full Text: Alexander Cummings’ 2023 Independence Day…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: LFA Appoints Ethiopian Selam Zeray on a Two-year…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: Armed Forces Operation Against Pirates Attack on a…  Jul 26, 2023 “Upon the pollution of the water, the company promised to provide supply water monthly and brought the consignment which included a few bags of rice and a sack of water. During this period, EPA tested swamp water and urged us to use it because it was safe,” he said. He said the town is getting water through the swamp water tested by EPA and sometimes when the rain is falling, stating “sometimes we don’t go for the rain water due to the blasting from the company that fell over the roof.”According to Getaweh, some members of the company have often visited Jikardor to test the river but failed to provide information to the leadership of the town. He said they recently tested the water twice, which raised concerns among residents of the town.Getaweh said several residents are getting sick including one the elder who is experiencing blindness adding that urgent intervention both the government and Bea Mountain is needed.He said the operation of the company is affecting various houses in the different towns and villages. Jikardor has around 61 family heads and almost 350 residents, which includes two villages.He said residents from the different affected communities decided to leave but were later asked to remain calm by leaders of the county,He furthers: “We decided to take our things and move to the company yard due to fear of bigger things.”Upon the pollution of the river, Getaweh said the leadership mandated the company to begin supplying the different communities with water but water supply is insufficient for the huge population of the towns.Bendu Dukuly, 23, a mother of two is a victim of the Bea Mountain chemical spill in Jikardor town, Grand Cape Mount County. She has complained of pain and continued itching of her skin as she craves for support to seek good medical attention.“We do not know about chemicals being dumped into the river. My brothers and I went down the river to go fishing. After we retired from the fishing, I then decided to have my bath later during the evening hour at the upper part of the river and this led to the start of skin itching later during the night and continued up to day,” Dukuly said.Dukuly said she has spent around US$100.00 for treatment and has helped to reduce the itching of my body and the continued blisters over my body which affected me greatly.“I went to the hospital and was given treatment. I was asked to buy additional medicines to reduce the itching of my body. It’s now helping to erase the marks from my skin. I also went to Kinjor Hospital which is owned by Bea Mountain but did not get enough treatment,” Dukuly asserted.Dukuly said the river was used to kill fishes for business purposes, cooking and washing but the chemical spill has stopped everything.

Liberia: President Weah’s County ‘Governmentally Marginalized’ on Public Information Officer,Contributing Writer,"Pres. Weah & Grand Kru County’s Superintendent Hon. Doris Nyanplane YlatunMONROVIA – Grand Kru County, the native home of Liberia’s Head of State, George Manneh Weah, has no Public Information Officer (PIO), some Grand Grand Kruans, living in and outside of the County, reported to this writer five days ago.By Samuel G. Dweh, Development Journalist (freelance)For now, only our County, Grand Kru, does not have a Public Information Officer, from my investigations outside and inside the Capitol Building,” one of the Grand Kruans said to me, but later warned: “Please do not put my name in the story you will write for publication in a newspaper, so that my boss won’t fire me. He’s one of those who should ensure that our County has a Public Information Officer now.A Public Information Officer is a Government official who gathers information about the Freedom of Information (FOI) Law of the about the County and informs Central Government through the Ministry of Information, Cultural Affairs & Tourism. The FOI law was created in 2010. The Employment Terms of Reference demands the PIO to be based in the County.After the ordinary Grand Kruans’ complaints, I spoke to Montserrado County-based Central Government’s representative in the County, County Superintendent Doris Nyaplane Ylatun, to confirm the reports from the civilians.What I know is, the County had a Public Information Officer, named John Bropleh, in 2015 and 2016. But he was replaced. In 2018, the current Government appointed a new Public Information Officer, named Jefferson Tweh. But Mr. Tweh remained in Monrovia, throughout service, refusing to come to Grand Kru County, his assignment area, because, according to him, his name was not on payroll. Later, I heard, he resigned. So, Grand Kru County doesn’t have a Public Information Officer at the time you and I are talking, Superintendent Ylatun narrated.Hon. Doris Nyanplane YlatunOn the Journalist’s question of whether Grand Kru County is the only Liberia’s geopolitical region without a PIO, Superintendent Ylatun replied: “I don’t have knowledge about Grand Kru County being the only geopolitical region with no Public Information Officer. I have not done investigations on each of the other fourteen Counties on this matter.”The now-Superintendent, a member of the Wedabo ethnic group of the County, has deeper knowledge about the County, from on her long stay in the County during part of the civil war time, and her extensive development-related tours during “Grand Kru County Coordinator” position of the Southeastern Women Development Association (SWDA), a body of development-oriented women of the four Counties that make up Southeastern Liberia. They are Grand Kru County, Grand Gedeh County, Maryland County, Rivercess County, and Rivergee County. SWDA’s ‘intervention projects’ were education of women on the Rule of Law and agricultural empowerment of individual women and women’s groups. SWDA was founded in 1996; it obtained its Article of Incorporation in 1997.To get the Ministry of Information, Cultural Affairs & Tourism’s side of the PIO-related story, I called the phone number of the Minister, Hon. Ledgerhood Rennie Monday, October 10, 2022. He replied, “Please text me.”Related Posts Liberia: Minister Sonii Extols Bea Mountain for Constructing…  Jul 22, 2023 Liberia: Man, 26, Arrested With Huge Ammunition in Ganta  Jul 3, 2023 Liberia: CDC Nominates U.S. Sanctioned Nathaniel McGill as…  Jun 30, 2023 I honored the Minister’s instruction—introduced myself and informed him about what I was writing about, and requested the MICAT’s side of the story on the PIO of Grand Kru County.However, MICAT’s response, through Minister Rennie, couldn’t reach me in four hours following my engagement with him via text message by my mobile phone.The information about the absence of a Public Information Officer in Grand Kru County is similar to information of the National Registration Identification (NIR) in the County. NIR documents the total number of citizens and issues ID card to each person who had gone through the interview process and qualifies for the ID card.“Grand Kru doesn’t have a liaison office of the National Registration Identification Registry based in Monrovia or Montserrado County,” the County’s Superintendent told me during an interview about this at her office during the Press Union of Liberia’s celebration of the World Press Freedom Day Liaison Office in Grand Kru County in 2021.“Up to the time you and I are speaking, there’s no NIR’s Liaison Office in Grand Kru County,” Superintendent Ylatun informed me on October 10, 2022.Grand Kru County is currently in the ‘Governmental Leadership’ of Liberia—Head of State (George Manneh Weah) of the County, Senate Pro-Tempore (Hon. Albert Tugbe Chie) of the County, and Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives (Hon. Jonathan Fonati Koffa) of the County. However, the County lags behind each of the other Counties on modern roads, better public health facilities, improved education sector, modern agricultural activities, national security, and many other human’s living-enhancement things. Majority of Liberia’s International Development Partners do not venture into the County due to “deplorable road conditions in the County”.On health-related issues of the County, for example, the County’s Senior Health Officer, Mr. J. Woyee S. Wreh, lamented the County’s chronic health lapses to a gathering of Journalists at the Wilmot Blyden Forum during the Press Union of Liberia’s celebration of the World Press Freedom Day in the County (2021) “No motorbikes for most of the Field Health workers, so sick people are transported in wheelbarrows or on the backs of relatives or friends. No Ambulance to transport chronically sick people living in remote parts of the County,” the County’s Senior Health Officer reported to the body of Journalists at the County’s Administrative Building in Barclayville, theCounty’s Capital.For electricity, only the County’s Capital enjoys regular electric current, but the number of houses that has light (during night time) is less than 30 percent of buildings—residential structures or business center.On education, the County’s representatives (from various High Schools) to the West African Examinations Council (WAEC) or the West African Senior Secondary Certificate Examinations (WASSCE) has led other Counties in the number of students who failed in majority of the subjects over six years from 2015. For the 2015/2016 WAEC, only two students—Fred Wesseh and Kieh Wisseh (of the Barclayville Central High School) passed.However, the County broke the spell of National and African Regional Exams failure in 2021/2022 WAEC by clinching ‘2nd Place’ next to Rivercess County.

Liberia: Bong County Representative Marvin Cole Threatens Female Political Researcher?,FPA Staff Reporter,"EDITOR’S NOTE: This article was first published on September 28, 2022, but has been updated due some factual errors that needed correction.GBARNGA – Faith Blapooh is a Liberian human rights activist, and a development practitioner. Since July 2022, her life has been in danger because of her involvement in a DAI/ USAID project called the Liberia Civil Society Activity. As a segment of this project, she conducted a Political Economic Analysis of Liberia’s health and Education sectors. She along with other team members, civil society organization implementing partners (Center for Transparency and Accountability- CENTAL in Liberia and National Youth Movement for Transparent Elections- NAYMOTE), and expatriates from the DAI home office in the US. This team worked in Liberia’s four most prominent and politically charged counties: Bong, Nimba, Lofa, and Grand Bassa. She led the health PEA team in Bong and Nimba counties as they conducted focus group discussions and Key Informant interviews among civil society activists, superintendents, County Health Officers, County Legislators, District Health Officers, Nurses, Doctors, OICs, etc. The PEA report lay emphasis on the below scope of interest.Related Posts Liberia: Minister Sonii Extols Bea Mountain for Constructing…  Jul 22, 2023 Liberia: Man, 26, Arrested With Huge Ammunition in Ganta  Jul 3, 2023 Liberia: CDC Nominates U.S. Sanctioned Nathaniel McGill as…  Jun 30, 2023 Decentralization policy and political willSources of revenue, sectoral funding and revenue sharing for service deliveryAccountability for Health Service DeliveryInclusive Decision-making for Health servicesService Delivery: Monitoring & Evaluating QualityAccess to and sources of informationBased on these questions above, 75 % of the interviewees pointed to Bong County lawmaker Hon. Marvin Cole and his political party the NPP as the spoiler of the health system in the county. Currently, faith has been targeted by Bong County District 3 lawmaker Hon. Marvin Cole. Honourable Marvin Cole is the NPP party’s most vocal and primary legislator in Bong County. He has the biggest hospital within his district, and he controls over 11000 youths in the county. Based on my involvement in the PEA process, his perception was that I brought “white people” to spy on him and to gather the information that would spoil he and his political party’s re-election bid. Representative Cole fears being sanctioned or reported to the US government for his involvement in corruption and human rights violation. He also complained that she would share the information with her oldest sister, and his jurisdiction over the biggest hospital in Bong County would be stopped. Moreover, he will lose connection with the hospital staff. Representative Cole fears he would also lose authority over the county’s social development fund, which he corrupts the hospital funding by sending 50% to his savings. Faith Blapooh oldest sister is a government appointee and serves as the County Health Officer of Bong County. He further asserted that miss Blapooh connection as a human rights and diplomacy professional and her connection with global human rights institutions could be leveraged at international conferences at the United Nations and other international organizations or functions to bring his corruption and deeds to light. As of current, Representative Cole is determined to harm faith and her close family members. Her life is seriously threatened. She managed to escape two attacks from torts, one of which was rape and almost stabbed on the 15 of September. The guys who came to attack her claimed to come from the lawmaker Marvin Cole. She was also subsequently attacked on September 25, damaging her car’s windshield. Her sister’s life and job as CHO has been threatened numerous times because of her attachment to Faith. Faith also had to resign from her job for fear of being accused by Representative Cole of unveiling his rampant corruption and mismanagement of the hospital. She believes her safety is at risk and Representative Cole is targeting her life.

Liberia: Senator Nuquay Denies Supporting Nathaniel McGill’s Senatorial Ambition?,Selma Lomax,"Margibi County – Margibi County Senator Emmanuel Nuquay has described the rumored senatorial ambition of the former Minister of State for Presidential Affairs Nathaniel McGill as a “stranger on job hunt”, and urged residents of the county to “shine their eyes” ahead of 2023 legislative and presidential elections.The former Chief-of-Staff to President George Weah, who resigned two weeks ago after he was sanctioned by the US Treasury Department for alleged corruption, is reportedly eyeing the senatorial seat of the county in 2023 after numerous consultations with stakeholders of the county. Mixed reactions have since trailed Mr. McGill’s alleged senatorial ambition, with many accusing Senator Nuquay of anointing him as his preferred choice.Clarifying his innocence to residents of the county at a town hall gathering in Kakata over the weekend, Senator Nuquay insisted he has no idea about McGill’s senatorial ambition, saying “I can’t take the Margibi people’s job and give it to a stranger.”“I have been accused of taking someone (the former Minister of State for Presidential Affairs Nathaniel McGill) from the Belleh Forest to bring him to the Gibi Mountain to take the Margibian (name for residents of the county) children’s job. I want to assure you that the information is untrue. I have no idea about Mr. McGill’s senatorial ambition,” Senator Nuquay said.Senator Nuquay said he has “no preferred candidate,” and has “anointed no one,” as senatorial candidate in the county.The Margibi County senator said he had a clear mind and was determined to ensure that “there shall be no imposition of anyone on the county.“My stance is intended to maintain the relationship he has been able to mend over the years, adding that his support behind specific individuals would disintegrate the unity he enjoys while working with everyone from across the divide,” Senator Nuquay said.“In no proxy political fight”Senator Nuquay had made it clear he was not into a proxy political fight with anyone in the county, urging those seeking elective positions in the county to focus on their campaign rather than attacking him.He noted that people are falling at odds with him for his development initiatives across the county, something they see as factors that would outshine their political relevance to the people.“There are speculations that I have convinced someone to contest against his wife, which is untrue. The reason why I am being attacked is because I continue to work in the interest of the people who elected me senator,” Nuquay told a group of women in electoral District Three in Margibi County.Related Posts Full Text: Alexander Cummings’ 2023 Independence Day…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: LFA Appoints Ethiopian Selam Zeray on a Two-year…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: Armed Forces Operation Against Pirates Attack on a…  Jul 26, 2023 “If you’re contesting as representative and senator, continue to run your campaign and forget about using my name. In 2020 when I was contesting as Senator of Margibi County there were people who opposed me, did you hear me complaining? No! I focused on convincing the electorates to vote for me rather than responding to those who were on the radio castigating me.”Senator Nuquay, who contested as running mate to Unity Party standard bearer Joseph Boakai in 2017 but lost in his native Margibi County seemingly due to perceptions against him that he would witch-hunt leaders of the county when elected vice president, said he doesn’t desire to repeat the instances that led to his dismal failure in the county, saying that doing so would breed disharmony amongst stakeholders and supporters of the county.Senator Nuquay told residents of Margibi County the process of electing people to various positions in the county in 2023 should be left opened void of his influence so as to allow the electorates make the determination regarding who leads them. “It’s better for the people to decide their leader,” Sen. Nuquay said.Against this backdrop, the People’s Unification Party (PUP) Senator is encouraging his supporters and friends to decide their leaders ahead of 2023 presidential and legislative elections.It can be recalled, Senator Nuquay supported several individuals in 2017 for legislative positions in the county, some of whom won and lost. This time, political pundits observed, the PUP lawmaker, once again, many are looking up to him for financial and moral support, something the senator has reportedly reneged on doing.Has PUP Margibi Chairman Cooper joined CDC?At an appreciation program organized by students of Margibi County Saturday in honor of Mr. McGill, what became a surprise to many was the enlistment of Francis Cooper, the Margibi County chairman of the PUP, as an “auxiliary of the Congress of Democratic Change”.Cooper, who has been chairman of the PUP for over two years, shocked many when he joined the parade with students and even made statement of support to McGill’s rumored senatorial ambition.Cooper’s presence at the program and his enlistment as an “auxiliary of the CDC” has drawn condemnations, with many calling for his resignation from the PUP.The majority bloc of the PUP National Youth Congress, in a statement, called on Mr. Cooper to his position as chairman of Margibi Chapter if the PUP.“We think this is the honorable thing to do as his action Saturday undermines his oath of office to protect, defend and uphold the norms of allegiance to the institution he serves as chairman,” the statement added.The party said Mr. Cooper’s action further undermines the standards of the PUP in an uncalled-for manner. “At this point in the national existence of our body polity, It is counterproductive for a party stalwart to pledge support to another individual of another party,” the party said.“Predicated upon Mr. Cooper’s action, it is equally fair enough to categorize him as an “extremist and McGill’s operative within the People’s Unification Party”.

Karfiah’s Risky Political Game: Support Against PUP Chairman in Bong’s District Seven Could Hurt Senate Bid?,Selma Lomax,"Gbarnga – The road to the 2023 senatorial election in Bong County is becoming more tortuous for the People’s Unification Party (PUP) aspirant Edward Karfiah, given the internal rift that has accompanied his decision to snub the party’s Bong County chairman and representative aspirant William Sumoward at the expense of non-party member Foday Fahnbulleh in District Seven.The decision by Karfiah, an elite member of the PUP, is against the party’s guardlines which gives guarantee to incumbent lawmaker and chairman to contest elective positions unopposed. Karfiah’s action has reportedly put him at odds with Sumoward, who has demonstrated committed to the PUP overthe years. Sumoward was one of the key persons who helped the party win the District Two by-election last year November.FrontPageAfrica has gathered that Karfiah’s decision to support a non-party party member over his chairman has put him at odds with some partisans, with many slamming his decision as “being ungrateful”.One partisan told FrontPageAfrica Saturday. “Karfiah is openly supporting Foday Fahnbulleh over our party chairman and wants us to support his senatorial ambition. This is hypocrisy at the highest level. Just how he has decided to support someone outside the party for representative, we too will support someone for the senatorial seat outside the party.”Another partisan told FrontPageAfrica: “What difference is Karfiah bringing as senator of the county when he is snubbing his partisans for someone from different party. Foday Fahnbulleh, we all know, contested on the ticket of Liberty Party in 2017 and still remains a member of the Liberty Party. Then you’re snubbing him for a chairman who has been loyal to you over the years.’FrontPageAfrica has gathered that Sumoward is reportedly angry with Karfiah for his decision, and has decided to still contest despite several meetings organized by stakeholders of the PUP to plea with him to relinquish his ambition.FrontPageAfrica has also gathered that Sumoward’s fury could lead him not to support Karfiah’s ambition, contrary to initial plans he made to campaign with him in the nooks and crannies of the county.Related Posts Full Text: Alexander Cummings’ 2023 Independence Day…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: LFA Appoints Ethiopian Selam Zeray on a Two-year…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: Armed Forces Operation Against Pirates Attack on a…  Jul 26, 2023 Sumoward is not the only PUP member who is contesting angry with Karfiah’s political gimmick. Steve Kennedy, a member of the PUP, is said to be angry with the District Five lawmaker over his refusal to openly announce support for his ambition despite having announced his support to his senatorial ambition.Karfiah, the incumbent representative of District Five who is serving his second six-year term, has made it clear that he doesn’t support any aspirant in the district, adding that endorsing someone would “cause uproar” in the district.And Kennedy told FrontPageAfrica: “I hear Hon. Karfiah saying he doesn’t support anyone in District Five. That means he doesn’t support me despite being a member of the PUP. “FrontPageAfrica gathered that Kennedy is poised to resign from the party if Karfiah doesn’t openly support his representative bid. “If Karfiah doesn’t support me I will resign from the party and endorse the senatorial ambition of Johnny Kpehe”.Besides the internal wrangling in the PUP, Karfiah appears to be faced with several headaches ahead of next year’s election, with a row with Rep. Marvin Cole and his “childhood friend” Henry Yallah taking a toll on his ambition.Yallah and Karfiah have been at loggerheads since the end of 2020 senatorial election, with Yallah accusing Karfiah of not supporting his failed ambition in 2020. Though Karfiah rejected the allegations, Yallah has vowed to contest against him.As for Rep. Cole, another influential lawmaker, he won’t support Karfiah’s ambition because he feels the District Five lawmaker is not the best person to lead Bong County as senator.Also, Senator Prince Moye, who is yet to announce his choice of candidate for the Senate, is reportedly planning on snubbing Karfiah’s ambition.According to political pundits, the lack of support from these stakeholders would make it impossible for Karfiah in 2023.

Liberia: ZOA Conducts Dialogue with Talk-Show Hosts and Radio Callers in Gbarnga,Selma Lomax,"Gbarnga, Bong County – Ahead of the 2023 Presidential and General Elections in Liberia, ZOA in partnership with ANGIE BROOKS International Centre has ended a daylong dialogue with talk-show hosts and radio callers on pre-elections campaign activities in Gbarnga.Giving an overview of the event, ZOA’s Project Officer in Bong County, Moses Bailey, said the one-day engagement was intended to enhance the understanding of citizens and media practitioners on major electoral policies ahead of the 2023 elections. He said due to the lack of training for radio personnel and their regular callers, some key electoral laws are always violated unknowingly by them on various radio talk-shows in the county.Facilitating the interactive forum at the Gbarnga Women Center, Mr. Daniel Newland, the Senior Elections Magistrate of Upper Bong for the National Elections Commission, clearly stated that pre-elections campaign is an offense under the Elections Law of Liberia, adding that it disrupts the level playing field for other candidates.He said though NEC is yet to take action against violators, the fine for pre-election vampaign is five hundred United States Dollars (US$500.00) or its equivalence in Liberian Dollars.“What pre-campaign does is that it disrupts the level playing field and also brings about provocation because others who observe the rules of elections are not given the opportunity to reach out to their people like the violators’’ Mr. Newland added.The NEC’s staff used the medium to call on radio station’s management in the county to put in place measures that will prevent political actors from campaigning ahead of the appropriate time.Related Posts Full Text: Alexander Cummings’ 2023 Independence Day…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: LFA Appoints Ethiopian Selam Zeray on a Two-year…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: Armed Forces Operation Against Pirates Attack on a…  Jul 26, 2023 Also speaking, participants of the dialogue thanked ZOA and its supporting partners for the knowledge impacted in them thus promising to share with others.Emmanuel Tamatai, an active radio caller in Gbarnga, lauded the two civil society organizations for the forum, but accused radio talk-show hosts of promoting pre-election campaign activities on their respective platforms. ”Like Mr. Daniel Newland said to us, the talk show hosts are the ones to control the activities of the callers in the morning, especially when there are issues under discussion. We as the callers are willing go by the rules and regulations but where sometimes the problem exists is when the first caller deviates from the main topic”, he added.Making remarks on behalf of Bong County’s CSOs, Mr. Mulbah Howard, the Secretary General of the institution, began by commending ZOA and Angie Brooks for bringing together Journalists along with Radio callers to enlighten their minds on Pre-Election Campaigning.“Pre-campaigning is just an issue that everyone needs to be careful of!

Liberia: Former Zogo Share Experience How He Overcame Drugs and Became Clean,Mae Azango,"Isreal Samuel Roberts declaring that he is now clean after being hooked on drugs for eight years; and Roberts narrating how he and others used to be taking the harmful substancesMONROVIA – Israel Samuel Roberts, a former drug addict, but now the class president of the New Life Recovery Center in Marshall, Margibi County, said he was hooked on narcotics for eight years, and used to smoke “coco” and heroin also known as “Italian White” or “Tai-girl”. But he has now been “clean” for 12 months without any narcotic substances in his system.“I dropped out of school because of drugs. I used my school fees to smoke drugs; I started stealing things from home to sell just to support my drug habit. I left home and slept in the ghetto for three years. Friends I used to help in school, all graduated before me. So, I decided to change. I was brought to the recovery center by my sister; but, because I was still going through the withdrawal stage, I ran away. I walked from Marshall straight to Boys Town because the drug was still in my system. When they brought me back, I ran away for the second time. I was bringing shame and disgrace to my family, so I decided to change. Now I have been sober for one year without any drugs in my system. I will remain clean,” Roberts promised. Roberts and few of his peers are lucky to be have been rehabilitated in the United Methodist Church-run recovery program. But over 250,000 young people across the country are still battling with narcotics addiction, with few rehabilitation centers in the country. This figure was obtained in a statistic conducted three years ago by the Liberian Government.According to UNFPA, it is estimated that two out of every 10 youth in Liberia are users of narcotic substances. And added that in order to sustain the desire and use of narcotic drugs, these young people who live in ghettos, street corners, and cemeteries often resort to crimes, including armed robberies.At the same time, President George M. Weah in June of this year, launched a national fund drive in support of a program for the rehabilitation and empowerment of At-Risk Youth in Liberia by the Government in collaboration with the United Nations and partners. He pledged an initial US$1 million as part of his administration’s contribution toward the project, which has been set at 30 months.The fund is intended to provide rehabilitation, skills training, social integration, and employment opportunities for these at-risk youths across Liberia.“Losing young people to drugs will affect the country’s human capital, thus impacting national development negatively. The demographics of our population who are being consumed by drug addiction means that we need to act quickly. The threat of imminent danger will continue to grow in size and scope if these potentially valuable human assets are not reclaimed, redeemed, and transformed into law-abiding citizens,” said President Weah.Funding for the rehabilitation and empowerment of these at-risk youths was estimated at US$13.9 million for the duration of the project. But it seems the Liberian Government’s gesture of US$13.9 million earmarked for the recovery of at-risk youth has not yet reached self-run recovery centers like the New Life Recovery Center.Jefferson B. Knight, who is the Director of the Recovery Center said since they started the recovery program in 2013, the government is yet to send them a subsidy.Related Posts Liberia: Minister Sonii Extols Bea Mountain for Constructing…  Jul 22, 2023 Liberia: Renowned Scientist Dr. Dougbeh Chris Nyan Lectures…  Jul 7, 2023 Liberia: Movement for Progressive Change Launches Free…  Jul 4, 2023 “Drug addiction in our country is a serious problem, but our national government has been playing lip service. We have not seen much done by the government regarding drugs addiction in Liberia. But many of our government officials are now getting involved because they hear some money was given to put into the drug rehabilitation program, while others are getting involved because of political interests.It is unfortunate, instead of these resources going towards rehabilitating our children to become useful citizens, they are now using those opportunities to amass wealth for themselves, according to my source,” said Mr. Knight.He disclosed that they have helped clean 110 persons, some of whom are doing well in the society, while a few went into relapse since its establishment in 2013. And their friends and partners are helping to erect the women recovery center that is now at roof level.“We are erecting the women’s rehabilitation center. But when will the government come to help us get the support we need? We need everything we can get to complete the women’s rehabilitation center, because many of our young women are dying from drug addiction. How many rehabilitation centers do we have in the country? We are getting young people from Bong, Nimba and Grand Bassa Counties coming to us to get clean. What is our government waiting for to help us in supporting this effort? What are our churches waiting for to create some spacesto welcome our brothers and sisters for rehabilitation programs in their buildings, because they have many empty rooms?Knight further said Roberts, who is also the class president, is now elevated to the position, of one of the staffs at the center to join the Center’s first pioneer, Mr. Oliver Pratt, who has been sober for 10 years.Mr. Knight’s appeal for assistance to help with the recovery processes of the youth, caught the attention of one of their partners, Mr. Jefferson Bates, who promised and volunteered to provide skills training for the young men at the recovery center. Also, giving his testimony at the Recovery Center was one Donald Wuanti, commonly called ‘Daddy Wuanti’. He serves as the “speaker of the house” for the center and had been an alcoholic for 15 years.“Alcohol destroyed 15 years of my life. I want to be thankful to Rev. [Celeb] Dormah because I am now three months sober,” Wuanti said.Wuanti further explained that his nightmare started when his father moved along with them to the US. And because he wanted to fit into the society, he adopted all the bad ways while in Philadelphia, because the community they lived in was tough, so he had to grow up with the tugs and gangsters and adapted their ways. But when they moved to Chicago, things changed, because it was a nice neighborhood and he wanted to be popular in school like every young boy his age, so he played sports, but at home, everything was not the same.“My father as a preacher, expected me to be the perfect kid who would be home reading my bible, but I wanted to be out there having fun. I got frustrated and turned to alcohol and started drinking. In order to make more money, I started selling all kinds of drugs in order to support my drinking habit. I went to prison, and when I got out of prison, few years later I saw myself getting off the airplane at RIA in Liberia. Imagine I had not been to Liberia since age six and I was 25 at the time when I returned, so things looked different. It was not easy on me in Liberia. One of the friends who returned home with me could not stand life in Liberia, because he complained of not being able to use bucket and flush toilet, so he committed suicide by hanging himself. Addiction is the most jealous thing ever, it is jealous more than any girlfriend you will ever have. Alcohol stopped me from achieving anything better in life. I used my three years tuition on alcohol and never went to class one day, while attending Stella Maris where I studied to become a Civil Engineer at the time.”Serving as the guest speaker at the program, was Rev. Celeb, Dormah, United Methodist Church’s Ambassador for at-risk youth. Rev. Dormah, who is also known as the ‘Zogo Reverend,’ among other things said the Church must take the lead in building rehab centers because for too long, it has relinquished its responsibilities to the “4th Estate,” which has become the watchdog of society. And the Church is the ‘first estate’ and the custodian of checks and balances in society.

"Liberia: UNFPA, Swedish Embassy’s Interventions Leading to Reduction of Maternal Mortality In Nimba",Gerald C. Koinyeneh,"MONROVIA – Health workers in Bahn, Nimba County said since the construction and dedication of a maternal waiting room at the Bahn Health Center, there has been no report of maternal death at the facility.Bahn is one of the most populated settlements in Nimba, the second most populous counties in Liberia. The health center has 28 catchment communities and provided health services to the thousands of Ivorian refugees stationed there for nearly two decades. The authority of the health center made the disclosure to a high-profiled delegation comprising of the officials of the Swedish Embassy, UNFPA and the Ministry of Health that visited the area recently.The team comprised the Deputy Head of Mission and head of the Swedish Development Corporation at the Swedish Embassy Johan Romare, the new Country Representative of UNFPA, Ms. Bidisha Pillai and the Assistant Health Minister for Curative Services Dr. Gorbee Logan. Others include officials of the British Embassy and the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection.Last week, the team conducted a joint field visit to sponsored project sites in Margibi, Bong and Nimba Counties to get firsthand accounts from the beneficiaries about the projects’ impacts, challenges that hindering their full utilization or implementation and recommendations.With 1,072 maternal deaths for every 100,000 births, Liberia has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world, according to UNICEF. The mortality rate of newborns, within the first 28 days of life, is also high—37 for every 1,000 live births.To curb this, the Government of Liberia and its partners have adopted several strategies, and one of it is the support to Maternal Child Health (MCH) programs. Through the program, the government banned home delivery by traditional midwives and along with its partners, set up maternal waiting rooms at major health facilities, mostly in rural areas, to host pregnant women nearing their delivery period. These women stay at the centers and are taken care of by nurses and professional midwives until they deliver safely.The Bahn maternal waiting room is a hybrid center uniquely build and providing basic healthcare to pregnant women. The MCH, comprises of eight bedrooms, nursing station and delivery rooms that has played a major role in reducing maternal deaths in the area.The Officer-in-Charge of the Health Center, Festus Yormie said since the dedication of the waiting room in September 2021, 299 pregnant women have registered at the center, and out of the number, there have been 280 safe delivery with no death recorded.The health center’s management disclosed that the facility is providing health services to a huge population in its 28 catchment communities and the Ivorian refugees; adding with the intervention of the UNFPA project, there have been increased awareness on sexual gender based violence in the community.Despite these numerous achievements, Yormie named several challenges currently affecting the facility; among them- lack of regular feeding for pregnant women, something that have driven patients to other community clinics.He also told the visiting guests that the health center is lack of employed staff as most of the workers are volunteers, and key among the challenges include limited drug supply by the Ministry of Health through the County Health Team based in Sanniquellie.Health records showed there have been 11 cases of domestic violence, prompting health officials to call for support towards creating more awareness in the community to break the entrenched cultural belief and practices.Related Posts Liberia: Minister Sonii Extols Bea Mountain for Constructing…  Jul 22, 2023 Liberia: Renowned Scientist Dr. Dougbeh Chris Nyan Lectures…  Jul 7, 2023 Liberia: Movement for Progressive Change Launches Free…  Jul 4, 2023 The delegation thanked the hospital’s management for the sacrifices in the midst of several challenges.Earlier on, the team visited the E and J Medical Center and had a brief interaction with the hospital’s administration and DKT International that is collaborating with the facilities to provide contraceptives for adolescent girls and boys.The supervisor of the MCH department Madam Julie Doe said more young people are turning out for the contraceptives, but the major challenges are the myths and misconceptions; with some are of the wrong beliefs that the contraceptives have harmful effects.Visit to Bahn Resettlement CampAs part of the tour in Bahn, the delegation visited the former Bahn Refugee Camp, now transformed to the Bahn Resettlement Center and met with several former refugees who have integrated in the community.At a town hall meeting, the beneficiaries lauded the Swedish Government and its implementing partners for providing shelter for them, but called for support towards their children’s education and funding for sustaining their livelihoods.When the refugee camp closed down, these Ivoirians decided to stay and make Liberia their home. To accommodate them, Plan International and UNFPA, with funding from the Swedish Government constructed 25 housing units.At a town hall meeting, the beneficiaries lauded the Swedish Government and its implementing partners for providing shelter for them, but called for support towards their children’s education and funding for sustaining their livelihoods.Speaking on behalf of the women, Rita Gailah thanked the donors for the support so far but said they there are gaps that needed to be filled during the integration process. She said all of the services that were once provided by the UNHCR have all gone away, and leaving them in total shock.Doumbia Musa, the beneficiaries’ spokesperson hailed the delegation for the support and appealed for electricity through the supply of solar panels.In response, UNFPA Country Representative, Ms. Bidisha Pillai thanked the residents for the reception and expressed hope that the structures built will provide safety for them, especially the women and children. She added it was good that they have integrated into the community.From Mat to MattressMeanwhile, the team visited the Kolakeh Peace hut women in Ganta.

The pending petitioning program for the suspended minister of state for presidential affairs is coming weeks after District Three lawmaker Marvin Cole and a confidant to McGill gave a hint to FrontPageAfrica that efforts were underway to encourage McGill to contest the Senate race in the county 2023.“The suspended minister has been under pressure from stakeholders of the county to contest the Senate race. Don’t rule anything out,” Rep. Cole.Prior to his suspension by President George Weah last month, McGill took years to establish several “political cells” in Bong County with the aim of supporting the re-election of President Weah in 2023.Related Posts Full Text: Alexander Cummings’ 2023 Independence Day…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: LFA Appoints Ethiopian Selam Zeray on a Two-year…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: Armed Forces Operation Against Pirates Attack on a…  Jul 26, 2023 In collaboration with Rep. Cole, McGill, while serving as minister of state, paid over LD $20 million in tuition aid to both private and public schools across Bong County.‘We want to reward McGill’To some of the petitioners, the suspended minister of state deserves a lot more for the work he has done for the people of the county, and deserves to be rewarded. “What he has done for the people of Bong County are so enormous that our politicians of the county hadn’t done over the years,” Amos Too, a resident of Kokoyah Statutory District.Jerry Fofana, a 26-year-old motorcyclist, told FrontPageAfrica Friday, he would campaign in the nooks and crannies of Bong County to ensure McGill is elected senator of Bong. His words. “Through the minister’s loan empowerment scheme, my mother benefited, and now she has a large business establishment. As for me, I had dropped out of school until our motorcyclist union benefited from a tuition aid from the minister. I’m proud to tell you I’m a second year student of the Bong County Technical College.”With 13 months to the 2023 presidential and legislative elections, McGill’s major headache would be convincing former Bong County senator Henry Yallah, a member of the Coalition for Democratic Change, to backoff from the race.It’s not clear whether Yallah would cave in, but insiders told FrontPageAfrica that the former Bong County senator is reportedly willing to cave in.If McGill accepts the citizens’ petition, it will make it 10 the number of aspirants who have declared their ambitions to contest, following declarations by former Bong County superintendent Ranney Jackson, District Five lawmaker Edward Karfiah, former agriculture minister Dr. Mogana Flomo, among others.

Liberia: ‘I Spoke in Context’: VP Jewel Taylor Clarifies ‘Politically-Irrelevant’ Bong Statement,Selma Lomax,"GBARNGA, Bong County – Jewel Howard-Taylor is facing backlash in her county for her comment that President George Weah will win re-election “with or without the support of Bong County,” with many locals taking to radio stations to call out the vice president for what they deemed an “ungrateful and unacceptable” comment.As of the 2008 Census, Bong had a population of 328,919, making it the third most populous county in Liberia. Howard-Taylor’s comment came in response to a concern raised by 26-year-old Beatrice Myers, a resident of Gbarnga, on Monday at the start of the vice president’s week-long dialogue with residents of the county.Beatrice was concerned as to why there was no cabinet minister from the county appointed by President Weah, since the dismissal of former agriculture minister Dr. Mogana Flomo, Jr in 2019, despite the overwhelming support received by the ruling Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC) in both rounds of the 2017 elections in the county.Beatrice said: “Madam Vice President, as the third-most populous county in the country, taking into consideration our (citizens of the county) role played in making George Weah president, and you our “daughter” vice president, what would be our reward as a county if we elect the CDC government for another six years?”“The Bong County Technical College is still an unfinished project, there is no market being built in Gbarnga despite the president talking about ongoing market in his state of the nation address, and the stalled Gbarnga street pavement construction.”Take a listen to VP Jewel Howard Taylor Saying “I believe with Bong County or without Bong County President Weah will win the second term”Jewel: “I’m sorry, didn’t mean harm”The vice president backtracked Wednesday and pleaded for forgiveness, saying: “I spoke in context, and was misinterpreted. I was simply trying to say that one county can’t make a president. In 2017, the people of Lofa County overwhelmingly voted former Vice President Joseph Boakai, and he still couldn’t win the election.”“I can’t betray the trust of the people of Bong County. If what I said didn’t go down well with the people of Bong, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean harm.”History of VP Taylor’s “insensitive” statements in BongThis is not the first time Howard-Taylor has faced backlash over “provocative” comments.In May of 2018, Howard-Taylor had gone gone to Gbarnga to install 13 commissioners of that county who were appointed by the CDC.During that program, she made a “divisive statement” that angered residents of the county.After greeting everyone who was in attendance, she said: “Truthfully, all of the 13 Commissioners [here] might not be members of the Coalition; we have got one or two who might not be members. Y’all must join because other people joined the Unity Party, too. So, I am waiting for y’all to call me from your districts to tell me that you are joining the ruling Coalition those of you who are not members. The Bible says ‘How can two walk together if they don’t agree?’ So, all ‘two’ of you must all be on the same side. So you see, if you can’t make it, you tell us so that we can find somebody else. Anybody, who feels that they are not able to make it must say it now before we go far,” she said.Related Posts Full Text: Alexander Cummings’ 2023 Independence Day…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: LFA Appoints Ethiopian Selam Zeray on a Two-year…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: Armed Forces Operation Against Pirates Attack on a…  Jul 26, 2023 Take a listen to VP Taylor proving clarity to her earlier statement on Bong County“When I call a meeting of the Coalition and someone [among you] is not part of the Coalition, the thing I want to talk, will I be able to talk it there? So you all just come on board with your whole hearts and minds.“To show that you all that some people who are sitting here are not members of the Coalition, you know we don’t have nothing in our hearts against you’ll because I would have said removed everybody. What would you have done to me? Nothing! This is my time. Nothing you will do to me. This is my time. We are not coming to give our birthrights to other people. This is our time to eat. We will eat but we are going to eat in a way that everybody will be able to eat, too.”Fury over VP commentOn Tuesday, wrath erupted in the county following the comment, with locals accusing Howard-Taylor of being “ungrateful” to the people of Bong, and called on the president not to select her as running mate ahead of the 2023 presidential elections.Francis Smith, a resident of Gbarnga, told FrontPageAfrica, said that Howard-Taylor’s comment was unacceptable by all measures, and called on the people of the county to take firm measures against the vice president’s words and the CDC in 2023.The statement is offensive not only to the people of Bong County, but also to the ruling Coalition for Democratic Change of which is a ranking member, Smith added.“This is what you get from someone who continues to benefit from the people of Bong County with nothing to show for,” he said. “It’s now time the people of Bong County shun the vice president and the ruling CDC because they have nothing to offer, as per the statement made by the vice president.”Prince Gorlormator, a native of Gbartala who was a delegate at the meeting, said: “The comment by the vice president should make residents of the county to rethink ahead of the 2023 presidential elections. We have voted for Howard-Taylor with high hopes and expectations only to hear statements of such from her. This is not only disappointing to the people of Bong County, but those who have voted her over those years.”‘Ungrateful’ Jewel?Howard-Taylor’s political career began in earnest when she was elected in 2005 as a senator in Bong, the county where her former husband and former Liberian president Charles Taylor’s legacy still lives among some locals.She won re-election in 2014, defeating eight men, including now senator Dr. Henrique Tokpa, former Bong County superintendent Ranney Jackson, and others.Howard-Taylor was a surprise pick for vice-president on the ticket of the footballer turned politician, as many expected her to run for the top job herself.But her selection paid off as Bongese (residents of Bong) overwhelming supported the CDC at the detriment of another prominent son of the county, Jeremiah Solunteh, who contested as running mate to Alexander Cummings of the Alternative National Congress (ANC).In upper Bong County, the Coalition for Democratic Change obtained 37,439 votes (63.1 percent), while Unity Party of Vice President Joseph Boakai received 21,859 votes (36.9 percent) of a total of 61,136 votes.In lower Bong, Weah’s CDC secured 33, 229 (65.5 percent), while Boakai’s UP accumulated 17,512 (34.5 percent). Invalid votes in this area amounted to 1,640.That was the first time the CDC had won both rounds of presidential elections in Bong, a feat many attributed to the presence of Howard-Taylor on the ticket.

The Swedish Government, through UNFPA and other partners including the Government of Liberia, is funding several projects in the health and education sectors as well as programs geared towards the promotion of the rule of law and gender equality among others in Liberia.The team comprises the Deputy Head of Mission and head of the Swedish Development Corporation at the Swedish Embassy Johan Romare, the new Country Representative of UNFPA, Ms. Bidisha Pillai and the Assistant Health Minister for Curative Services Dr. Gorbee Logan. Others include officials of the British Embassy and the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection.The team is conducting a joint field visit of sponsored project sites in the three Counties to get firsthand accounts from the beneficiaries about the projects’ impacts, challenges that hindering their full utilization or implementation and recommendations.At a stop in Gbarnga, Bong County on Monday, August 29, the team met with the hospital’s administration and students of the Esther Bacon School of Nursing and Midwifery. They also visited and toured the Phebe Hospital, the largest referral hospital in the county.The Phebe Hospital’s medical director, Dr. Jefferson Sibley told the delegates at an indoor program that through the joint support of the Swedes and implementing partners including the Government, there have been much improvements in the hospital’s fistula program. He said out of 26 patients, 24 were treated through surgical operations conducted by a volunteer international surgeon.He called for support towards the program to assign a resident fistula surgeon to treat patients regularly instead of waiting on surgeons who come occasionally from abroad.He called for the budget of the fistula repair program to be increased to cover transportation for returning fistula survivors to their communities. Also speaking, the Director of the Esther Bacon School of Nursing and Midwifery Humphrey Loweah, said the Phebe paramedical training program has achieved a lot from the partners since they began supporting in 2019. Mr. Loweal named the expansion and completion of the skill laboratory and library as a major turning point for the school.Loweal noted that since their intervention in 2019, enrollment and graduation have increased. “UNFPA has really been helpful to the Phebe School of Nursing since 2019,” he said. “Before the support, the school had never graduated more than five students, but right now we have more people graduating and as I speak, we will have about 14 persons graduating from the school very soon.”He told the delegation that for the past six semesters, there has been no dropout and the school has changed from awarding diploma to degree. For the first time, midwives will be graduating with degree, thanks to the support from the Ministry of Health, Swedish Government and UNFPA, he said.He then appealed for increased funding for the Phebe training program to continue training and producing quality healthcare workers, increased support to the school’s supplies to commensurate with enrolment.Related Posts Liberia: Minister Sonii Extols Bea Mountain for Constructing…  Jul 22, 2023 Liberia: Man, 26, Arrested With Huge Ammunition in Ganta  Jul 3, 2023 Liberia: CDC Nominates U.S. Sanctioned Nathaniel McGill as…  Jun 30, 2023 In addition, the administrator called for full support to Phebe, especially the Anesthesia program to meet academic requirements since Phebe is the only anesthesia school in the country. He also wants support to be extended to other programs including professional nursing and medical laboratory technology since they healthcare providers including the nurses, midwives, anesthetists and lab technicians are all partners in healthcare provision.The students also joined the school’s administrator in thanking the donors for the support. Robert Korquoi of the Anesthesia department and Yah N. Kpawolo of the midwifery section, in separate remarks, called on the donors to make available mean of transportation for their clinical activities and affiliation, especially for students from hard-to-reach areas including Lofa, Nimba and the southeastern region. With 1,072 maternal deaths for every 100,000 births, Liberia has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world, according to UNICEF. The mortality rate of newborns, within the first 28 days of life, is also high—37 for every 1,000 live births.Speaking briefly, Dr. Logan said, with these statistics, there was a need for continued support to the Phebe School of Nursing and Midwifery to train more midwives and paramedics giving the acute shortage of manpower in the health system.The Assistant Minister for Curative Services noted that the support to the school was timely and ideal as it is the training hub for nurses and midwives in Liberia. On behalf of the Ministry of Health and the Liberian Government by extension, he thanked the Swedish Government through UNFPA for the meaningful interventions.UNFPA Country Representative Ms. Pillai lauded the Phebe Hospital and the Esther Bacon School of Nursing and Midwifery for helping UNFPA make strides in achieving its goal. She said the works at the institutions have direct impact in making sure that every pregnancy is wanted and every delivery is safe.The Deputy Head of Mission and head of the Swedish Development Corporation at the Swedish Embassy in Liberia Johan Romare thanked the Phebe Hospital and the paramedic school – both administrators and students for the warm reception and for drilling them through the happenings at their institutions. He assured them of the Swedish Government’s continued support, adding the team was on the ground to see and listen in order to make informed decisions.Hope for PrisonersThe delegation also visited the Gbarnga Central Prison and interacted with the prison supervisor and inmates including convicts and pre-trial detainees who are benefiting from the skill and adult literacy program funded by the Swedish Government through UNFPA.Through the program, inmates learned basic skills including tailoring, soap making and other arts and crafts; while mostly juvenile inmates are benefiting from the adult literacy program.The acting Superintendent of the Gbarnga Central Prison, Richard Mulbah said beneficiaries are selected based on the gravity of the crimes they committed and commitments and cooperation. He said since the training was launched, 40 inmates have graduated and of the number, five have reintegrated.He added that to sustain the program, plans are being worked out to sell the products that are being produced by the beneficiaries on the local markets to use the fund generated to keep the program running.He appealed for certification of inmates who have graduated from the training by the sponsors and the Government of Liberia to show as evidence when seeking employment opportunities following their reintegration into their communities. He called for continued support to the program to help combat crimes.“I think this program is very good because it will help them when they are released from jail. This is the only way that crimes would be minimized in the county because when they are set free and have something doing, obviously they won’t want to engage themselves into bad things,” Mulbah said.The tour continues to several projects sites in Bong and Nimba Counties.

"Liberia: ForumCIV Awards Grants to 11 Partners in Bong, Grand Gedeh and Bomi Counties",Selma Lomax,"Gbarnga, Bong County – The management of FORUMCIV-Liberia has provided grants to 11 implementing partners in Bong, Grand Gedeh and Bomi counties under its progam titled “Our Land”.According to ForumCIV’s Country Representative Asa Chon, the program will be implemented under the theme “A pathway to sustainable ownership and land use for women and youth in Liberia”. He added that the project will be implemented for a period of 40 months and would help empower women and youth from rural communities in the three counties in land governance and management.The ForumCIV boss furthered that the “Our Land” program will also increase marginalized women and youth access to ownership and control of their land for sustainable development and resilience to climate change.Chon identified rights-based approaches, development perspectives, grant administration, capacity development advocacy, an awareness-raising platform, and networking as project methodologies.Mr. Chon clarified that the selection of the 11 implementing partners was done following a critical scrutiny by panels from ForumCIV Liberia and the Stockholm office.Related Posts Liberia: Minister Sonii Extols Bea Mountain for Constructing…  Jul 22, 2023 Liberia: Man, 26, Arrested With Huge Ammunition in Ganta  Jul 3, 2023 Liberia: CDC Nominates U.S. Sanctioned Nathaniel McGill as…  Jun 30, 2023 He then cautioned all implementing partners to ensure straight compliance with the terms and conditions of the grant, as ForumCIV will not hesitate to terminate all agreements for noncompliance.ForumCiv appreciates the support of Sida to her programme in Liberia and globally. ForumCiv extends gratitude to national and county TV level authorities for supporting our direct interventions in Liberia since 2018.“We are also glad that during the past weekend, the legislative caucus of Bong County, the local authority and civil society met and agreed on a way forward for the setting up of the first ‘County Council’ as mandate by the Local Government Act of 2018 and the May 2022 decision of the Supreme Court of Liberia. We believe that this singular action by Bong County sets a huge National Precedence and it will pave the way for Inclusive Governance and the promotion of Transparency and Accountability in Liberia,” Chon said.“Today, we will sign grant agreements with 11 partners. Eight of these partners received funding from ForumCiv under our previous programme, and three of these partners contributed to the implementation of that programme. The selection of these 11 partners where done in line with ForumCiv granting standards which follow the OECD criteria and Istanbul principles. I chaired the Grants Committee which made the final decisions. (It was a delight to read and select many interesting projects with promising impact.).”For the next three years and plus, Chon said he hopes to partner with these organizations and others who will be subsequently selected to implement our new programme called ‘Our Land’ which is funded by Sida.Like the previous programme, this new action will focus on strengthening civil society organizations that are based in the rural counties of Liberia.Using Land Rights as an entry point, the programme will promote Democracy and Human Rights, Environment and Climate Change, and Gender Equality. ForumCiv will contribute to build strong and independent Civil society actors representing rights holders or communities.ForumCiv as an organization has a policy of ‘Zero Tolerance’ towards corruption and our whistleblowing policy is available for use by the public and our partners whenever there is a need. For their part, the implementing partners appreciated FORUMCIV Liberia and its partners, with a pledge to ensure the actualization of the goal of the project.

Liberia: Ex-Bong Supt. Ranney Jackson Declares Interest in Senate Race in 2023?,Selma Lomax,"Gbarnga – Former Bong County superintendent Dr. Ranney Jackson has declared his interest to run as a Senator in 2023.Dr. Jackson made the declaration on Saturday while addressing supporters in Gbarnga upon his return from the United States of America. “I have come to inform you of my intention to contest the 2023 senatorial race in Bong County,” Dr. Jackson said.Dr. Jackson will be contesting the Senate race for a record fourth time, having contested 2005, 2011, and 2014 elections, losing on all of those occasions.His best finish was 2011 when he lost to Henry Yallah by over 700 votes, accumulating over 27, 000 votes.Under Jackson’s watch as superintendent, Bong County recorded a lot of developments, including the fencing of the David Kuyon Sports stadium, renovation of the presidential compound, rehabilitation of the superintendent’s compound, and the provision of electricity in Gbarnga, among others.His supporters think Jackson remains the most prepared for the Senate seat considering his experience in party politics at the county level.Related Posts Full Text: Alexander Cummings’ 2023 Independence Day…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: “Our democracy is under threat” – Alexander…  Jul 25, 2023 Liberia: Minister Sonii Extols Bea Mountain for Constructing…  Jul 22, 2023 Were the race to be a senator of Bong County a free gift Jackson would be easily crowned because of his rich credentials.Jackson’s ambition, however, hinges on whether his brother-in-law Tokpa will seek re-election. According to many, negotiations are underway for Tokpa to back off for Jackson, but it’s not clear whether Tokpa has caved in to allow Jackson to contest.As one of the oldest aspirants in the race, Jackson’s influence and popularity would be brought to bear as he would not need an introduction to the electorates. Political observers say Jackson is not too close to the grassroots in the county, a major factor that led to all his defeats during the time he contested.Dr. Jackson, a former legislator in the National Transitional Legislative Assembly (NTLA), told FrontPageAfrica:“When I, along with my Committee on Post and Telecommunication, was able to break the monopoly on the cellphone industry,” he added.Continuing, he said: “Now today, we have many cellphone companies and different denominations of payments for minutes instead of a $15.00 USD payment for phone cards. I was able to suggest that for the first election in 2005, two representative seats be given to each county before we go by population, for fear that without such policy, Montserrado could get all of the seats since almost the entire population was in Monrovia. Still Montserrado got 17 seats while some counties got only two seats. Our country needs a strong legislature if our country will need to move forward.”Jackson’s declaration brings to nine the number of candidates who have announced their intentions to contest.As at press time there were eight persons who have shown interest, including District Five lawmaker Edward Karfiah of the People’s Unification Party (PUP), former Bong County Senator Henry Yallah of the ruling Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC), former Agriculture Minister Dr. Mogana Flomo, former president of the Federation of Liberian Youth (FLY) and a member of the opposition All Liberian Party (ALP), Mohammed Nasser, the former ruling Unity Party (UP), and business man Johnny Kpehe, Amos Barbu, of the National Patriotic Party, andFactors that will determine the winner of next year’s election will include the aspirant’s personality and acceptability, party strength, support of a critical segment of the population in Bong County, and the aspirant’s financial capability.

Liberia: ‘Lofa Youths Can’t Read’ – Sen. Zargo Denigrates Young People from His County  ,Willie N. Tokpah,"MONROVIA – Lofa County Senator Steve Zargo has taken a stinging attack on the young people of Lofa who voted him with his assertion that they cannot read even a sentence properly or pronounce his name correctly.“Young people were paid to issue statements against me. These young people in Voinjama cannot even read a sentence or pronounce my name correctly,” the Lofa County lawmaker in an interview on August 17, 2022, at his office on Capitol Hill in Monrovia. Senator Zargo’s statement came in the aftermath of a press conference held in Voinjama by a consortium of youth groups in the county that he was using his position as Chairman of the Liberian Senate Standing Committee on Defence and Intelligence for political reasons.The young people indicated that it is sad that a lawmaker who sits in a critical position at the Liberian Senate would indulge in acts that are unrepresentative of a national leader and elect to spew out misinformation to score political points under the guise of speaking on critical national issues instead of beingpreoccupied with the thought of dispensing independent security advice for the general benefit of the country.“Senator Zargo should desist from using the Chairmanship ofDefense,Securityand Intelligence of the Honorable Liberian Senatefor personal, selfish political gains.We believe it’s high time the senate considers whether Mr.Zargowho’s consumed in political bigotry should continue to hold a crucial position as Defense, Security and Intelligence Chair or an independent, professional Senator should.Related Posts Full Text: Alexander Cummings’ 2023 Independence Day…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: LFA Appoints Ethiopian Selam Zeray on a Two-year…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: Armed Forces Operation Against Pirates Attack on a…  Jul 26, 2023 The Lofa County Senator accused Mayor Jefferson Tamba Koijee at a press conference of masterminding the violent protest that took place before the United States Embassy near Monrovia that led to one person critically injured on the heels of Liberia’s 175th Independence Day celebration. He then called for the suspension of the Monrovia City Mayor on grounds that alleged perpetrators of the protest were believed to be seen with Mayor Koijee.Pundits are wondering why is it that the man who was elected by predominantly young people in 2015 would choose to vilify them in a way that is demeaning.“The man was elected to fix the system that would improve education and other sectors in the country. His assertion against the young people of the county is a clear indication that he failed miserably to ably represent their interest at the national level. He should be ashamed of himself that he is making fool of the young people for voting him into power,” Yamah Mulbah said in an angry voice.For Saah James of Zorzor District, he thinks the Senator is right about his assertion since the youth have refused to learn their lessons. “You can’t blame Jorkpor [Senator Zargo’s other name]. We should blame ourselves as young people of the county for allowing ourselves to be deceived by characters like that who is insensitive to our plight but would use it to insult us,” Saah pointed out.The young James indicated that the assertion from the Senator that Lofa youths cannot read is his way of appreciating the young people for voting him and he did nothing for them.

Liberia: Villagers Managing Forest But Sector Woes Haunt Them?,Contributing Writer,"Villagers in Bahn Town, the headquarters of Jo River and Nyorwein Community Forest, are excited they can now benefit from their forest. The DayLight/Emmanuel Sherman NYORWEIN, RIVER CESS – Throughout the two bordering clans of Jo River and Nyorwein far away in the Central River Cess District, villagers expect their logging agreement with Magna Logging Corporation to bring much-needed development to their community.By Emmanuel Sherman, with The DayLightThe newest among 49 authorized community forests across the country, they have leased their land in exchange for roads, toilets, scholarships and clinics, according to the agreement. Those benefits aside, Magna is required by the Community Rights Law of 2009 with Respect to Forest Lands to pay affected communities for use of their land and each log it harvests in the 39,000-hectare forest.But their hopes could be dashed, given the nature of the logging industry, particularly, community forestry. The 12 years of community forestry has been spiteful rather than sparkling for many communities. Forestry Development Authority (FDA) appears to side with companies more. There are reports ofillegal loggingin several communities. Companies and individuals areabandoning woodsthey harvest at an alarming rate, owe communities thousands of United States dollars and the FDAapproves new contractsfor them. Jo River & Nyorwein does not have to look far for some of these grim examples. Between 2020 and last year, African Wood and Lumber Company, another logging firm, illegally cut550 logs in the Gbarsaw & Dorbor Community Forest. The FDA representative responsible for the county was suspended and replaced. It owes that community thousands and has yet to conduct mandatory projects.Similarly, in Ziadue & Teekpeh signed three years before Jo River & Nyorwein, Brilliant Maju and E&J Investment Corporationhave not lived up to their agreementwith the community. The company duo has failed to implement projects, sparking protest last year. Following the hostilities, it made a commitment to construct eight handpumps and two latrines in affected communities between September last year to February this year but has not completed them. These industry woes are already at Jo River & Nyorwein’s doorsteps. Before its contract with the villagers here, Magna had not lived up to its agreement with Worr Community Forest in Compound One, Grand Bassa County. (It had paid Worr all its land rental, harvesting and scholarship fees, though.) When it signed the agreement in August last year, the company had not done any roads, still had to complete five handpumps, and had not rehabilitated a clinic it agreed to do by that time.Magna is also in breach of its contract with Jo River & Nyorwein. The company has yet to begin operation since signing the agreement in August last year. It also has not paid its land rental fees of US$26,105 to the community. It has not done a major road leading to the forest, something locals consider a priority, according to the agreement. “We really need roads, where there is a road there is life,” says Philip Ben, one of the community’s leaders in an interview with The DayLight in Buchanan.Broken-down equipment of E&J Investment Corporation in Ziadue & Teekpeh in River Cess. The DayLight/Emmanuel Sherman“Since we signed the agreement last year, we have not had a meeting with them again,” says Alice Giahyou, another member of the leadership. The agreement mandates the villagers and the company to hold periodic meetings whose expenses the company must underwrite.Molley Kamara, the owner of Magna says the meeting will be held in a week’s time. “There is a community meeting on August 20. I am pretty sure the community’s concern will be addressed,” Kamara tells The DayLight in an email.“First, it is less than one year ago [since] we signed with Jo River [& Nyorwein]. And we are not worried,” Kamara adds.

Ben, Giahyou, and have capacity problems and no knowledge of forest governance. Its leadership is not aware of the sector practices and legal frameworks. “We know some of our rights… but we don’t understand all,” Giahyou adds.There were indications the leadership of the community are not aware that their agreement with Magna is a public contract. Ben refused to share a copy of the agreement with The DayLight. He initially accepted to give our reporter the agreement, following a week of discussion. When the reporter finally tracked him down at his Worldwide Church in Buchanan, he asked the reporter to first buy legal papers to photocopy the documents. But he stormed out of the arrangement when the reporter came back with the papers. The reporter then demanded he repays the funds used to purchase the papers. Ben refused to repay until the intervention of members of the church.Paul Nickerson, the head of the community leadership, also refused to share a copy of the agreement with The DayLight while in Monrovia in July. Nickerson eluded us three times before he stopped answering his phone. He only phoned us when he was already back in River Cess.Weedor Gray, the technical manager for FDA’s community forestry department did not grant The DayLight’s request for access to the agreement, though the document is a public record. No contracts are available on the agency’swebsiteas required by the National Forestry Reform Law. We obtained it from elsewhere. Gray did not return our emailed request for comments.The Answer is Women’s ParticipationFoundation for Community Initiative (FCI), which promotes the empowerment of women and youth in the natural resource sector, has begun working with Jo River & Nyorwein to strengthen its capacity. The four-year project encourages women like Giahyou to participate in the governance of the forest. It has been holding community meetings and using local radio stations to raise awareness in the area.With funding from the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD), FCI will also work in Ziadue & Teekpeh, according to a document on the project. “Jo River and Nyorwein have a lot more to do, their knowledge and skill in forest governance are very limited,” says Felix Foyah, a campaigner of FCI who works on the project.Foyah says FCI is building on the important relationship women play in forestry to help Jo River & Nyorwein meet the challenges in the sector. Women tend to use forest resources more than men. Many women know which trees are for food and medicine, and how to conserve forests—important knowledge during food crises, according to the FAO. Evidence shows that increased women’s participation in community-forest leadership improves forest governance and sustainability, according to a 2019report.“That is exactly what we hope to achieve. Once there are more knowledgeable women on forest matters that are in the community leadership, they can better combat illegal logging, deforestation and forest degradation,” says Foyah. Only five out of nearly 50 members of the leadership of Jo River & Nyorwein are women.“We know that there are a lot of issues in forestry,” he adds, “but that is how we can solve those problems.”Zahn Dehydugar of the Community of Forest and Environmental Journalists of Liberia (CoFEJ) contributed to this report.This story was originally published by The DayLight and has been republished here by permission.

Liberia: Local Platform Highlights Deplorable Roads in Lofa County Ahead of 2023 Elections,Contributing Writer,"VOINJAMA – Lofa County has always had her fair share of representation in government. From the likes of former Vice President Harris F. Moniba, during the Doe’s era to the Ellen Johnson Sirleaf-led government, where again the county was given the Vice Presidency slot for her two terms of office. Since 1964, when the county was created, there has always been one major challenge confronting the county: The quality of roads network.Jackson F. Kanneh, Contributing WriterLofa, which many referred to as the “breadbasket” of Liberia” seem to have lost that edge due to the lack of road or existing bad road network to take its produce to market especially.Monrovia, the seat of government. The county used to supply folks in Monrovia with almost every food item ranging from rice to plantain to groundnut and pepper. But the pre-war years of Lofa are far from the post-war Lofa county, all because of the lack of better roads. To say that the road network is hampering development in the county would be an understatement. From President Tubman to Willian Tolbert era to the Samuel Doe’s regime, the Lofa’s road construction has always been ignored or paid lip service to by politicians of every governing government in Monrovia, and encouraged by local Lofa politicians. It’s due to this inaction, especially during the raining season when transport to and fro to the county is halted, that gives birth to the ‘Lofa 2023 Project’ by citizens of Lofa both in and outside of Liberia to shame national leaders into action as far as it relates to building the Gbarngba- Menikoma highway. Meanwhile, while the Lofa road network has been kicked around by both past and present governments, other counties such as Nimba, Maryland, Grand Kru, etc in southeast Liberia, have been prioritized by both past and present governments.Related Posts Full Text: Alexander Cummings’ 2023 Independence Day…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: LFA Appoints Ethiopian Selam Zeray on a Two-year…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: Armed Forces Operation Against Pirates Attack on a…  Jul 26, 2023 Road connectivity in Nimba county is at a greater speed while a single road from Gbarnga Bong county entering Lofa is languishing in the mud. See attached photos. This is the question I posted to the current Minister of Public Works, while other counties have paved roads, but the people of Lofa county don’t? “We’re aware about the bad road network in Lofa and we’re doing everything to start the construction of Gbangba- Salayea road project. She added that one factor that was delaying the construction was for the GOL to come up with funds to pay residents whose homes would be damaged as a result of the road network. I’m glad to say that we now have that fund. Once the dry season comes we will begin the construction.”Despite what the Minister said, four years ago, Lofians thought their road problem was all over when former President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf took on current President of Liberia then senator of Montserrado county George M. Weah in 2017 to breaks ground for the 81-kilometer road from Gbarnga to Salayea as first face of the original Gbarnga to Mendikoma highway road project. Five years and counting, the Gbarnga to Salayea is at a standstill, as up to the time of writing this article, no single inch of the Lofa land has yet been paved as the project is still languishing on the Bong county side of the border. Meanwhile, transportation to and fro Lofa has soared as a result of the current rainy season. Transport has soared from $,4000.00LD to $7,000.00LD. Even with the increase in fare most goods aren’t making it to Lofa or from Lofa, as you can see in the pictures with various truck and pickup owners laboring to navigate the bad muddy road. Because of the bad roads aggravated by the rainy season, citizens in Lofa county are now using motorcycles as a major means of transportation in the county.The downside is that the bike might be able to transport people, but what about the goods and commence to and fro Lofa? Some folks who can’t afford the fees of the motorcycles have to use the traditional means of movement by walking on foot to their destination. “We slept in the forest with our market for days and some of our goods got damaged while heading to Monrovia from Lofa,” one distressed passenger narrated upon reaching the red light in Paynesville, Monrovia. At the dismay of Lofians, the projects in Sanniquelle to Ganta and other road projects in Maryland, Grand Gedeh, Sinoe and Grand kru are going on at a fast speed. None of these counties have the perilous muddy road that the people of Lofa go through during the rainy season.As this writer was recently in Ganta during the retreat of the governing CDC, the roads are like night and day compared with Lofa’s muddy roads. The PWM admitted to this fact during her confirmation hearing at the senate. She indicated that at that time the government had not met her obligation of the agreement in the tone of US$1.3 million to resettle affected property owners along the road. “We were not happy the last time we came here, and so we have been making all efforts to accelerate this process,” she noted. According to her, all materials needed for the project are all available now and road work will be in full swing once we enter the dry season. Madam Cooker-Collin indicated that all factors that was the delaying project are now taking care of including the resettlement of affected property owners by the government of Liberia.As Lofians eagerly await the rainy season where most parts of rural Liberia can have easy access through paved roads, the debacle of the Lofa road will remain a campaign issue. As one prominent Lofa in the diaspora said. Adding, “All the people of Lofa ever asked for is a paved road and we will feel the nation with our abundance of food.” Speaking to this platform, some prominent citizens from Lofa in the current regime who asked not to be named, because he doesn’t want to anger his boss, President Weah, noted that “it is hard time the government of Liberia prioritize road building especially in Lofa county.” ",15/08/2022,https://frontpageafricaonline.com/county-news/liberia-local-platform-highlights-deplorable-roads-in-lofa-county-ahead-of-2023-elections/,1

Lofa Youth Slam Own Senator for False Allegations Linking Mayor Koijee to ’26 Violence,Selma Lomax,"MONROVIA – A consortium of Lofa youth leaders and university students have slammed the county’s Senator Steve Zargo over his comments that the City Mayor of Monrovia Jefferson Koijee be suspended pending the outcome of the July ’26 Independence Day fracas.The group said it wouldn’t have dignified the “misguided statement” of Sen. Zargo, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Security and National Defense, made with a response but for the unsubstantiated allegations, and by his wrong insinuations, he unjustly tried to malign Koijee. The group said Sen. Zargo’s attempt to link Koijee to the unfortunate situation on ’26 Day was to denigrate and impugn his reputation.“We find it quite disturbing that a senator of Zargo’s standing would descend so low in expressing his hate for the Monrovia City Mayor.Sen.Zargo who should be preoccupied with the thought of dispensing independent security advice for the general benefit of the country has willfully elected to desecrate the hard standards of the position of Defense, Security, and Intelligence of the Honorable Liberian Senate for personal, selfish political gains.”“We believe it’s high time the senate considers whether Sen.

Zargo claimed, the group said it had thought the Lofa Senator would have used his press conference to denounce violence and educate Liberians more on the tenets of insecurity rather than unjustifiably reference Mayor Koijee.“We are even deeply concerned by the broad day hypocrisy of how Mr. Zargo who constantly stirs up tribal confusion in Lofa county and has come under several public condemnations on his campaign of hate and tribal rhetoric can now suddenly turn out to be a person ‘’concerned about security,” the said.The group said the statement released by Senator Zargo on Koijee was “out of frustration” because he and other leaders’ failure to emancipate the people of Lofa County from underdevelopment has given rise to the likes of Koijee, Thomas Fallah and Co, who continue to work to improve the lives of ordinary natives of the county since their rise to power in 2018.“Lofa believes only with the likes of the new breed of government officials from the county can the county benefit from its actual share of the national cake as being exhibited,” the group said.“Sen. Zargo and others have failed the people of Lofa and it’s time they take the exit door; a million press conferences will not help him.We at the same time call on the outgoing Senator to apologize to Mayor Koijee for his wild and negligent statement spewed out earlier Tuesday.“We want to reiterate our zero tolerance for violence and welcome the recent statement condemning violence and calling for swift prosecution of perpetrators by the President of Liberia, His Excellency Dr. George Manneh Weah as well as the International Community. We believe this is in the right direction for our fledging democracy.”Zargo, who’s seeking re-election in 2023, has come under immense criticism for making “conflict-sensitive” statements after he called on Lofians (natives of Lofa) not to vote for a Kpelle-speaking Senator, as the county was home to the “real owners”, including Lorma, Kissi, Mandingos, Gbandi.

"Liberia Agency for Community Empowerment Breaks Grounds  for Construction of Housing Units For Pregnant Women, Doctors, Nurses in Lofa ?",Obediah Johnson,"MONROVIA – Pregnant women, especially those traveling from towns and villages far away from medical centers in Lofa County, are expected to benefit from the construction of 12 housing units to alleviate the numerous constraints they encountered while seeking adequate healthcare delivery.The women have been catching hell by commuting and sitting for hours on commercial motorbikes and vehicles and sitting for several hours just to give birth at public health facilities mainly in Fissebu and Zorzor districts. Hammocks and wheelbarrows are also being reportedly used to transport them to the facilities. Some even trekked long distances just to get to those facilities for maternal healthcare, while others renege on visiting to get their regular medicines due to the distances from their homes to the facilities. Few others lost their lives or the lives of their unborn babies before reaching these medical centers while en route on foot.As part of efforts to address the situation, the Government of Liberia (GOL), through the Executive Director of the Liberia Agency for Community Empowerment (LACE), Mr. Quiwu Pepci Yeke, over the week end broke grounds for the construction of the housing units to address the situation.He also paved the way for the construction of another five housing units for doctors and nurses assigned at the clinic in Salayea a nd separate city halls for residents of Zorzor and Fissebu.Speaking during a brief ceremony marking the event, Mr. Yeke disclosed that the move was in fulfillment of promises made to the locals by President George Manneh Weah during his nationwide tour.Some time ago, the Liberian Chief Executive toured the 15 political sub-divisions of the country to listen and help address the plights confronting the citizens.He used the occasion to inform the citizens that President Weah has made a decision to construct his dwelling place in Fissebu, Lofa County.“People can be thinking where is Zorzor or Fissebu so, these housing units will be between the two areas because of the interconnection of the two towns because we are all one people. If you can recall during the county tour, the President decided to sleep in Fissebu because of the love he has for the people. The President wants that when he comes to Lofa, he has a home here and so, the landlord should help find the land and we will make sure that the house is constructed before January 2023. Fissebu has been the chosen one in Lofa and so, don’t miss that opportunity”.“The essence of these housing units is to see to it that those pregnant patients who are coming from far away and most of the time ride the ambulances or get on motorbikes-it difficult get somewhere better to be. We are trying to curtail the situation and so, we will build 12 housing units which will give us about 24 rooms”.Mr. Yeke stressed that authorities of the medical facilities will maintain and spearhead the accommodation of pregnant women at the units free of charge.When completed, the LACE boss disclosed that the beneficiaries will occupy the units for between one to two months before or after giving birth and are released to go back to their respective homes in faraway places.He further stressed the significant roles the Curran Lutheran and Salayea hospitals and clinic continue to play in providing healthcare delivery to citizens from nearby and other faraway places, especially during the heat of the Ebola and Coronavirus pandemics.He pledged to make additional interventions including the supply of running water, provision of air conditioners, and others at the two medical facilities.“We are not noted for giving cash to individuals, but we also decide to help institutions because help for the hospital is helpful for the entire Zorzor district or Lofa. We are not doing these things for the staff, but for the patients. Lofa will benefit everything that the President said he will do”.Mr. Yeke further emphasized that the provision of five housing units for nurses and doctors assigned in the area was intended to shelter and ensure that they have somewhere to stay not too far from the medical center.He stressed that medical workers would be more punctual, committed, efficient and effective in carrying out their assigned tasks and responsibilities when their wellbeing is dignified following the completion of the project.“The President made a promise that he was going to build a city hall in Zorzor. And we are here to make sure that everything the President said comes to fruition. We are not just breaking ground for this project today.

"Liberia: Senator Moye Dedicates Projects Worth US$140,000 in Bong?",Obediah Johnson,"GBARNGA — For several decades, thousands of residents of Gbartala and Goineimah towns in Bong County have been battling multiple constraints preventing them from gathering to collectively discuss issues and find lasting solutions to the numerous challenges confronting them and their respective areas.The two areas are located in Yellequelleh and Suacoco districts. The lack of a public hall compelled the locals to reportedly gather under the sun or jammed-packed the homes of their neighbors to hold meetings on pertinent issues relative to their wellbeing.The youths in the area were also constrained to spend more time on the farm or hunting due to the lack of a recreational center to amuse themselves.But the barriers were broken during the late afternoon hours of Wednesday, July 27, when the county Senator Prince Kermue Moye constructed and officially turned over two landmark and well-furnished town halls to the locals.Speaking at separate programs marking the dedication of the newly constructed projects, Senator Moye recounted his struggling days growing up in Gbatala.He disclosed that the fulfillment of the project in the areas was his own way of giving back to the citizens who have been very supportive and instrumental towards his sojourn.He recalled that the project in Gbatala commenced after the residents unanimously requested the construction of a hall during his consultation for the senatorial seat of the county in 2019.“I grew up and sold in the streets of Gbatala as a child. As a way to give back to Gbatala, I first thought it was through business. I brought my first gas station right up the hill, but I felt it was not enough. I came for a meeting here and there was no light; no space and the only thing the citizens told me was, ‘we want a hall’. So, Gbatala being without a sitting place, I thought it wise to honor their request and I have come to say thank you”.Senator Moye pointed out that though his critics expressed skepticism over the completion of the two landmark projects in the areas following his decision taken to intentional abandon the projects ahead of the senatorial elections, he finally completed the initiatives void of any political reasons.“The citizens told me that politicians been coming and we been breaking grounds and electing people and so, this other breaking ground should not be a business as usual. At the peak of the 2020 elections, we thought that this was not a political project and so, I didn’t had time to finish the project and the people didn’t bargain on me finishing the project before they could vote for me.”“I saw my past selling in the streets in this same place and said ‘let me test them’. I stop the project deliberately to see the commitment of the people but this district gave me the highest votes in the whole Bong County”.Senator Moye disclosed that the construction of the hall is an addition to the mini ambulance provided to the locals to say “thank you for the true love and commitment”.He named the hall in Gbartala as the “Senator Dr. Henrique Flomo Tokpa Multipurpose City Hall”, and the one in Gwenima Town as the “Tuah E. Mulbah Community Hall.He disclosed that the decision taken to name the facilities after these eminent citizens was due to an agreement reached with the locals.Related Posts Liberia: Minister Sonii Extols Bea Mountain for Constructing…  Jul 22, 2023 Liberia: Man, 26, Arrested With Huge Ammunition in Ganta  Jul 3, 2023 Liberia: CDC Nominates U.S. Sanctioned Nathaniel McGill as…  Jun 30, 2023 Senator Moye emphasized that his colleague, who is a former President of the Cuttington University in Suacoco, played a pivotal role in providing scholarship opportunities and others to children and duxes of all high schools across the county.“We took politics out of this project and decided to do something in honor of Dr. Tokpa while he is alive”.He also dedicated a road he rehabilitated in Palala, Bong County.Prior to its reconditioning, the road which leads to mayor towns and villages was almost impassable for motorists and pedestrians.The three projects rehabilitated and dedicated by Senator Moye worth US$140,000.Also speaking, Senator Tokpa expressed shock over the naming of a project in his honor though he did not provide support from his pockets.“Senator Moye named his son after me; that’s how deep our friendship is. I want to thank you Honorable Moye and the people for this building. This building will live forever and I want to tell the people of Yellequelleh that I will put foot too one day. I served this county and Liberia wholeheartedly and all of you people know what I did here”.He lauded the citizens for the decision taken to canvass and vote for his colleague to excel at the level of the Liberian Senate.For his part, former Vice President Joseph Nyemah Boakai used the occasion to remind young people that the future of the country lies in their hands.Ambassador Boakai is the Political Leader of the former governing UP.He said despite the circumstances or conditions they are encountering on a daily basis, Liberians should not forget where they came from.He maintained that citizens should embrace developments being carried out in their respective communities by their kinsmen and avoid being sway away by others who do not mean well for them.“Leadership is about giving back to our people and I am not surprise that Senator Moye is always giving back to his people. We should continue to give back to our communities especially naming them after one another. Young people, always remember where you come from”.Ambassador Boakai further observed that the construction of palava huts to accommodate the locals is a primitive idea and as such, the construction of town halls must be embraced to accommodate citizens as the population in the various communities continue to grow on a regular basis.Meanwhile, the beneficiaries have lauded Senator Moye for the “dedication of the remarkable projects” that will go a long way down in the history of their communities.They said the fulfillment of the projects shows the commitment and dedication of Senator Moye towards their wellbeing.“We have absolutely no regret for making Senator Moye our leader. If election was tomorrow again, we will vote for him again and again. When you are in a relationship with a woman and the woman loves you, you will know”, an elderly man stated in Goineimah Town.

"Liberia: Company Abandons Some 2,500 Logs in Zorzor, Lofa County?",Contributing Writer,"Some of logs Sing Africa Plantation Liberia Limited abandoned at its Sawmill in Zorzor, Lofa County. The DayLight/James Harding GiahyueEditor’s Note: In this second part of a series on Sing Africa Plantation Liberia Limited, we reveal how the Singaporean logging company abandoned a large number of logs in Lofa and Grand Bassa. BALAGWALAZU, Lofa County – Sing Africa Plantation Liberia Limited, a Singaporean logging company, might haveharvested about US$2.2 million worth of logs outside its concession in Bluyeama Community Forestmainly between 2018 and last year.Report by James Harding Giahyue, with The DayLightBut it has abandoned about 2,500 logs it cut within that period, including logs the company illegally harvested, further investigation The DayLight conducted into the firm’s operations discovered. Around a fifth of the logs have already decayed. Legally, logs are abandoned when they are left unattended between 15 and 180 days, depending on their location and the result of a three-month government-run inquiry. That means even logs Sing Africa felled in December last year, the latest of its production, are abandoned.Our calculations of the company’s official production and export records between 2019 and last year show that it has 1,426 logs that have not been exported. Having only obtained production and shipment data in volume between 2017 and 2018, we estimated the difference of 10,761 cubic meters to be 1070 logs. The logs are scattered at different locations. Most of them are in the company’s sawmill in Balagwalazu, with some in its log yards on the Gbarnga-Lofa highway and in Grand Bassa County.We counted about 500 woods—several with Sing Africa markings—in a large open field in Buchanan, all of which have already decayed. Their remnants created sponge-like coatings everywhere as if the area were a graveyard for trees. You could take the cawing of birds that pierced the quietude of the deserted area for a eulogy.“It’s not even good for charcoal now,” said one woman, who did not want to be named due to safety reasons. The members of the leadership of Bluyeama Community Forest, who monitor the company and have records of all its operations, corroborated our findings. Gayflorson Korballah, one of Bluyeama’s leaders, pointed out huge piles of logs that had been harvested in 2017 and 2018. Alexander Songu, the head of the leadership, said most of the ones in the log yard had been harvested in 2019. We traced some of the logs to the company’s official production records from their tracking numbers. Tracking logs is a major component of postwar forestry reform in Liberia. Every tree felled must have an identification number that can be used to track logs from harvest to export.The illegal logging and the failure of the company to pay the community its benefits have left locals frustrated. Since 2009, villagers have had the right to manage their forests alongside the government. Bluyeama, a 49,444 hectare woodland in the Zorzor District bordering Gbarpolu, was certified in 2011.Following a difficult relationship withEcowood, a previous logging company, it signed an agreement with Sing Africa in January 2016. But the company has not lived up to its promises. It owes both the Liberian government and the community US$121,271, according to the record of a meeting of players in the forestry industry on the implementation of Liberia’s Voluntary Partnership Agreement (VPA) with the European Union official records released in March earlier this year. That is one of the highest debts any company owes in the entire forestry sector.Loss of Revenue The Forestry Development Authority (FDA) has known about the abandoned-logs issue since, at least, two years ago, evidence shows. In August 2020, an inquest by the agency found that Sing Africa abandoned 675 pieces ofekki wood (Lophira alata), an expensive, first-class log, in Buchanan. It also found that Star Wood—run by the Guptas, the Singaporean family that owns Sing Africa—left 465 logs at that same location.Related Posts Full Text: Alexander Cummings’ 2023 Independence Day…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: LFA Appoints Ethiopian Selam Zeray on a Two-year…  Jul 26, 2023 Liberia: Armed Forces Operation Against Pirates Attack on a…  Jul 26, 2023 Some abandoned logs in a log yard on the Gbarnga-Lofa highway, owned by Sing Africa Plantation Liberia Limited. The DayLight/James Harding Giahyue“Logging contract holders are not doing much to minimize [the] incident of abandoned logs,” the report, leaked to us, said at the time. It said companies were harvesting logs without first securing sales contracts.“Much-needed revenues that the national government requires for national development have been lost due to the unprecedented abandonment of assorted round logs by logging companies,” it added. But it was only two months ago that the FDA started to take action. In April, it gave all companies a one-month period to declare the logs they had not shipped. Managing Director Mike Doryen told The DayLight a countrywide auctioning of abandoned logs would have begun at the end of that month, which did not happen.“[Bluyeama] is an area of concentration for ourselves,” Doryen said. “Those who did not remove their logs as per the stipulated time, the lawyer will now go to the court to seek judicial actions to have the logs confiscated the auctioned.”Doryen’s timeline for an auction was impossible. It takes several months of court orders and required notices for abandoned logs to be auctioned, according tothe Regulation on Abandoned Logs, Timber and Timber Products. There were no records of such order at the circuit courts in Voinjama and Buchanan. It was until earlier this month that the FDA began to inquire countrywide about abandoned logs, following threereportsby The DayLight on the subject. Harris Zeah, the ranger responsible for Lofa, Bong and Margibi, wassuspended and replaceda week after our report of illegal logging in Bluyeama. “Management’s action is predicated upon your consistent failure to meet work plan objectives, including your failure to adequately and timely address noncompliance issues in… the Bluyeama Community Forest,” Zeah’s suspension letter read.Mukesh Gupta, Sing Africa’s CEO and head of the Guptas, denied any wrongdoing, blaming the coronavirus pandemic. “We were loading by containers but when the Covid-19 hit, there was no buyer,” Gupta told The DayLight in an interview at the company’s Rehab office in Paynesville. “Covid-19 has damaged us so much. I think I should be supported, given the kind of investments we have made in the community.” Though the pandemic shattered supply chains worldwide, especially in the Asian markets Sing Africa exports its logs, the company continued to cut trees. Between 2019 and 2020, it harvested 2,000 logs, according to official records. And while it only exported 189 logs during that time, it added 166 logs the following year. It did not apply for force majeure, a legal recourse companies take to address things like disease outbreaks, conflicts and natural disasters.“We never cut the trees thinking that they would be abandoned. We cut the trees thinking that Covid-19 would go away soon. We are surprised that Covid-19 has stayed on for long,” Gupta added.Sing Africa faces millions of United States dollars in fines and could be one of the heaviest in the Liberian logging industry’s history. Abandonment of woods in log yards, sawmills and ports carries a fine of three times the international prices of each class of logs. The regulation was created to prevent waste of forest resources and to make sure companies harvest logs sustainably. It replaced an earlier regulation that narrowed the definition of abandonment to logs found outside a concession, lacking tracking barcodes. Its establishment in 2017 came amid a crackdown on illegal logging by importing countries, including the European Union. Waste of the logs from Bluyeama adds to the Zorzor region’s forest loss. From 2002 to last year, the district lost 20.6-kilo hectares of humid primary forest, according to Global Forest Watch, which tracks deforestation worldwide. That number is one of the highest among community forests, according to a study by the FDA and the World Resource Institute, a global research charity. Tree cover loss refers to the removal of forest canopy by people or nature.Zahn Dehydugar of the Community of Forest and Environmental Journalists contributed to this report.
