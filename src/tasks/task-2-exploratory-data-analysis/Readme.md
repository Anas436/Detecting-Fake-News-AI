# Exploratory Data Analysis

We can go with the below steps:
## Class Distribution Analysis:

- Calculate the proportion of legitimate news articles to fake news articles in the dataset:
    - Count the number of articles in each class (legitimate vs. fake) and calculate the percentage distribution.
- Visualize the class distribution using a bar chart or pie chart:
    - Use a bar chart to display the count or percentage of articles in each class.
    - Create a pie chart to visualize the proportion of articles in each class.

## Article Length Analysis:

- Analyze the distribution of article lengths (in terms of words or characters) for both legitimate and fake news articles.
    - Calculate the length (word count or character count) of each article in the dataset.
    - Generate summary statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation for article lengths in each category.
- Compare the summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) of article lengths between the two categories.
    - Compare the mean or median article lengths between legitimate and fake news categories using descriptive statistics.
    - Conduct a hypothesis test (e.g., t-test) to determine if the differences in article lengths are statistically significant.
- Visualize the distribution of article lengths using histograms or box plots to identify any noticeable differences.
    - Create histograms or box plots to visualize the distribution of article lengths for each category.
    - Compare the distributions visually and identify any noticeable differences.

## Vocabulary Analysis:

- Identify the most frequent words or phrases used in legitimate and fake news articles separately.
    - Tokenize the text data into words or phrases.
    - Calculate the frequency of each word or phrase in each category.
- Calculate the word frequency or TF-IDF (Term      Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) scores to identify important keywords in each category.
    - Count the occurrence of each word in the dataset or calculate the TF-IDF scores to determine the importance of words.
- Visualize word clouds to display the most common words, highlighting any significant differences between legitimate and fake news articles.
    - Generate word clouds separately for legitimate and fake news articles, highlighting the most common words in each category.
    - Compare the word clouds to identify differences in frequently used terms.
## Temporal Analysis:

- If available, analyze the temporal aspect of the dataset by plotting the frequency of fake news articles over time (e.g., monthly or yearly).
    - Extract the publication dates or timestamps from the articles.
    - Group the articles by month, year, or any other relevant time interval.
- Look for any patterns, spikes, or trends in the occurrence of fake news.
    - Create line plots or bar charts to visualize the number of fake news articles published over time.
- Compare the temporal patterns of legitimate and fake news articles to observe any differences.
    - Overlay the frequency of legitimate news articles with fake news articles to observe any differences in trends or patterns.

## Sentiment Analysis:

- Perform sentiment analysis on the articles to determine the polarity (positive, negative, neutral) of the content.
    - Apply a sentiment analysis algorithm or pre-trained sentiment analysis model to the text data.
- Compare the sentiment distributions between legitimate and fake news articles.
    - Calculate the distribution of sentiment scores (positive, negative, neutral) for legitimate and fake news articles.
- Analyze if there are any significant differences in the sentiment scores for each category.
    - Conduct hypothesis testing to determine if there are statistically significant differences in sentiment between the two categories.
    - Visualize the sentiment distributions using histograms or box plots to observe any disparities.

## Topic Modeling:

- Apply topic modeling techniques (such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation or Non-Negative Matrix Factorization) to identify latent topics within the dataset.
    - Utilize algorithms such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) or Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to extract latent topics.
- Explore if there are any distinct topics associated with fake news articles compared to legitimate news articles.
    - Identify the topics associated with fake news articles and compare them to those in legitimate news articles.
    - Evaluate the coherence and interpretability of the extracted topics.
- Visualize the identified topics using word clouds or bar charts.
    - Generate word clouds or bar charts to display the most common words or phrases in each topic.

## Named Entity Recognition (NER) Analysis:

- Implement NER techniques to identify named entities (such as people, organizations, locations) in the news articles.
    - Use libraries or models that provide NER functionality (e.g., spaCy, Stanford NER).
- Analyze if there are any differences in the types or frequencies of named entities between legitimate and fake news articles.
    - Extract named entities (people, organizations, locations) from the text data.
    - Calculate the frequency of different types of named entities in legitimate and fake news articles.
- Explore whether certain named entities are more prevalent in one category compared to the other.
    - Compare the occurrence and distribution of named entities between legitimate and fake news categories.
    - Identify any significant variations in the types or frequencies of named entities.

## Correlation Analysis:

- Examine the correlation between different features extracted from the text data (e.g., word count, sentiment scores) and the target variable (legitimate vs. fake news).
    - Calculate the correlation coefficients (e.g., Pearson's correlation) between different features and the classification of news articles.
- Calculate correlation coefficients (such as Pearson's correlation) and visualize the correlations using heatmaps or correlation matrices.
    - Create heatmaps or correlation matrices to visualize the strength and direction of correlations.
- Identify features that have a strong positive or negative correlation with the classification of news articles.
    - Identify features that have a high positive or negative correlation with the legitimacy of news articles.
    - Prioritize features with strong correlations for further analysis and model development.
