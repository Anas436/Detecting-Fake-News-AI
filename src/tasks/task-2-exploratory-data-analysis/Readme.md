# Exploratory Data Analysis

We can go with the below steps:
## Class Distribution Analysis:

- Calculate the proportion of legitimate news articles to fake news articles in the dataset.
- Visualize the class distribution using a bar chart or pie chart to understand the class imbalance. This will help determine if any class imbalance handling techniques are necessary during model training.

## Article Length Analysis:

- Analyze the distribution of article lengths (in terms of words or characters) for both legitimate and fake news articles.
- Compare the summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) of article lengths between the two categories.
- Visualize the distribution of article lengths using histograms or box plots to identify any noticeable differences.

## Vocabulary Analysis:

- Identify the most frequent words or phrases used in legitimate and fake news articles separately.
- Calculate the word frequency or TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) scores to identify important keywords in each category.
- Visualize word clouds to display the most common words, highlighting any significant differences between legitimate and fake news articles.

## Temporal Analysis:

- If available, analyze the temporal aspect of the dataset by plotting the frequency of fake news articles over time (e.g., monthly or yearly).
- Look for any patterns, spikes, or trends in the occurrence of fake news.
- Compare the temporal patterns of legitimate and fake news articles to observe any differences.

## Sentiment Analysis:

- Perform sentiment analysis on the articles to determine the polarity (positive, negative, neutral) of the content.
- Compare the sentiment distributions between legitimate and fake news articles.
- Analyze if there are any significant differences in the sentiment scores for each category.

## Topic Modeling:

- Apply topic modeling techniques (such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation or Non-Negative Matrix Factorization) to identify latent topics within the dataset.
- Explore if there are any distinct topics associated with fake news articles compared to legitimate news articles.
- Visualize the identified topics using word clouds or bar charts.

## Named Entity Recognition (NER) Analysis:

- Implement NER techniques to identify named entities (such as people, organizations, locations) in the news articles.
- Analyze if there are any differences in the types or frequencies of named entities between legitimate and fake news articles.
- Explore whether certain named entities are more prevalent in one category compared to the other.

## Correlation Analysis:

- Examine the correlation between different features extracted from the text data (e.g., word count, sentiment scores) and the target variable (legitimate vs. fake news).
- Calculate correlation coefficients (such as Pearson's correlation) and visualize the correlations using heatmaps or correlation matrices.
- Identify features that have a strong positive or negative correlation with the classification of news articles.
